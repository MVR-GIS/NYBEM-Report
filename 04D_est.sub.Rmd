## Estuarine, Subtidal Submodel (`est.sub`)


This section presents development of the estuarine, subtidal submodel (est.sub). Estuarine subtidal habitat was defined as areas with elevations between MLLW and -20m with salinities ranging from 0.5 to 30 psu. In general, the est.sub seeks to capture the general condition and trajectory of the estuarine subtidal habitat using three different taxa (oysters, SAV, and clams) as indicators of ecosystem quality. Each taxa provides critical contributions to the overall quality of the ecosystem. 


A conceptual model of the estuarine subtidal habitat was developed at a mediated modeling workshop (Appendix A). The conceptual model represented the major components affecting the quality of the ecosystem. Three main categories of drivers were identified: physical (water quality, velocity, sedimentation), anthropogenic (vessel traffic and development stress), and biological (SAV, benthic organisms, fish) with interactions among the categories. Conceptual models were then refined in two key ways (Figure XX). First, it was assumed that essential fish habitat would be present if oysters, SAV, and clams were present, so this variable was removed. Second, substrate type is a major driver of SAV, oysters, and clams. In general, the ecosystem can be coarsely divided into hard bottom and soft bottom habitats roughly correlated with oysters and SAV/clams, respectively. The unique characteristics and drivers of these habitats led to splitting the est.sub model into modules for each of these substrate types. 


![*Conceptual model for the estuarine, subtidal submodel.*](ZZ_Fig07_Est.Sub_ConModel.png)

The est.sub modules was split into hard and soft bottom habitats (`est.sub.hard` and `est.sub.soft`, respectively). **Insert text differentiating hard bottom and soft bottom habitat**. All substrate data are merged from the [TNC Substrate Map](https://maps.coastalresilience.org/newjersey/#) and the [usSEABED](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/cmhrp/science/accessing-usseabed). Grain size are from XXX (**DO WE HAVE THIS?**), and fine substrate composition are from TNC.

est.sub.hard
Salinity = 0.5 to 30ppt
Subtidal (MLLW to -20m) 
Median grain size >= coarse sand

est.sub.soft
Salinity = 0.5 to 30ppt
Subtidal (MLLW to -20m) 
Median grain size <= coarse sand

Alternative approach...known or historic hard bottom (i.e., any historic mapped oyster reef)?


### Hard Bottom Habitats (`est.sub.hard`)


Oysters are a major indicator of the integrity of hard bottom habitats in the New York Bight, and the hard bottom submodel is represented by an **adaptation** of the Oyster Habitat Suitability Index Model (OHSIM @swannack_robust_2014). The OHSIM is a USACE-certified model for the Eastern oyster (*Crassostrea virginica*). OHSIM is a spatially-explicit, grid-based index model that uses a series of linear equations to calculate habitat suitability for *C. virginica*. The model consists of four variables: substrate and three measures of salinity â€“ 1) mean salinity during spawning season, in which spawning and spat set have a higher optimal salinity than for survival of adults, 2) annual mean salinity, which is the expected range over which adult oysters are viable, and 3) minimum annual salinity, which defines the impacts of high mortality events resulting from lower salinities due to freshwater influxes [@soniat_understanding_2012]. Variables are briefly described below, and more details can be found in @swannack_robust_2014 and EcoPCX documentation. 

For the NYBEM, spawning season salinity data were not available, so only three variables are used. The overall habitat suitability of the estuarine, subtidal, hard bottom ecosystem is aggregated into a single metric via a geometric mean of these three suitability indices (following the OHSIM).

$I_{est.sub.hard} = {(cultch * sal.min.ann * sal.mean.ann)}^{1/3}$ 

Where $I_{est.sub.hard}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the estuarine, subtidal, hard bottom habitats, $cultch$ is a suitability index relative to hard bottom composition, $sal.min.ann$ is a suitability index relative to minimum annual salinity, and $sal.mean.ann$ is a suitability index relative to mean annual salinity. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal.

#### Oyster Substrate

Substrate is represented as the percent of the bottom covered with hard substrate, such as existing reefs, or other hard surfaces. We assume that oyster habitat suitability increases linearly from 0 to 100% cultch cover. 

$$cultch = 0.01*hard_{per}$$ 

Where $cultch$ is a suitability index relative to hard bottom composition and $hard_{per}$ is the percent of the substrate that is hard bottom.

#### Minimum Annual Salinity

Minimum Annual Salinity (MAS) is the minimum value of the 12 monthly mean salinities. This variable is essential to describe freshwater impacts (e.g., freshets, high rainfall years, or freshwater diversions) on oysters and is analogous to the frequency of killing floods variable used by @cake_habitat_1983. For NYBEM, we use a representative low salinity (i.e., the tenth exceedence percentile, $S_{10}$) rather than a minimum of monthly average. The relationship between MAS and its suitability index is formulated as a linear step-function as follows: 

$$sal.min.ann = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0 & MAS=0-2\\
0.025*MAS-0.05 & MAS=2-4\\
0.225*MAS-0.85 & MAS=4-6\\
0.250*MAS-1.00 & MAS=6-8\\
1.0 & MAS>8
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $sal.min.ann$ is a suitability index relative to minimum annual salinity, $MAS$ is the minimum value of the 12 monthly mean salinities, and $S_{10}$ is the tenth exceedence percentile of the annual salinity values, a proxy for MAS.

#### Annual Mean Salinity

Annual Mean Salinity (AS) represents the range of salinities over which adult oysters are viable [@@cake_habitat_1983]. The relationship between AS and its suitability index is formulated as a linear step-function as follows:

$$sal.mean.ann = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0 & AS=0-5\\
0.2*AS-1.00 & AS=5-10\\
1.00 & AS=10-15\\
0.08*AS-2.2 & AS=15-20\\
0.07*AS-2.0 & AS=20-25\\
0.03*AS-1.0 & AS=25-30\\
0.01*AS-0.4 & AS=30-40\\
0.0 & AS>40
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $sal.mean.ann$ is a suitability index relative to mean annual salinity and $hard_{per}$ is the percent of the substrate that is hard bottom.

#### Key Gaps in `est.sub.hard`

This model for hard bottom habitat omits some important variables and processes. Notably, mean Salinity during Spawning Season (MSSS) represents reflects the higher optimal salinities required for spawning and larval stages [@butler_summary_1954],[@@cake_habitat_1983] and is part of the OHSIM framework but omitted here.  


### Soft Bottom Habitats (`est.sub.soft`)


Estuarine, subtidal soft bottom habitats comprise large portions of the study areas and host a variety of taxa of interest to environmental management. Specifically, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds and hard clams are focal targets of management. Specifically, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds and hard clams are focal target of management. However, these two outcomes have different ecological drivers. As such, the `est.sub.soft` model represents a hybridized approach that attempts to assess the general condition of this habitat type relative to both major outcomes. 

Habitat suitability is assessed separately for SAV and hard clams. The overall habitat suitability of the estuarine, subtidal, soft bottom ecosystem is aggregated into a single metric via a maximum of the separate suitability indices. This approach assumes that a given patch does not need to be perfect for both taxa simultaneously, but instead, the habitat could have high quality relative to one or the other outcome.

$I_{est.sub.soft} = max({I_{sav},I_{clam})}$ 

Where $I_{est.sub.soft}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the estuarine, subtidal, soft bottom habitats, $I_{sav}$ is a suitability index relative to submerged aquatic vegetation, and $I_{clam}$ is a suitability index relative to hard clams. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal.

#### Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Module

The SAV submodel is represented by three variables critical for growth and reproduction of seagrass, (1) substrate, (2) light availability, and (3) development stress. Suitability scores are represented either as discrete categories or as step functions with linear interpolations between steps. 

$I_{sav} = \frac{substrate.sav + light + vessel.density}{3}$ 

Where $I_{sav}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation, $substrate.sav$is a suitability index relative to fine substrate, light is a suitability index relative to light penetration, and $vessel.density$is a suitability index relative to boat traffic and human uses (a proxy for development stress). All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal.

Substrate is represented as the presence of soft-bottom sediments conducive for SAV  growth. Optimal conditions for growth in the study region were identified as non-cobble substrates with less than 70% fine sediment. Soft-bottom, non-cobble substrates with greater than 70% fine sediment were considered sub-optimal/adequate. Suitability scores for SAV substrate are represented as follows:

$$sal.mean.ann = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & fines_{per}=0-70\\
-0.033*fines_{per}-3.33 & fines_{per}>70\\
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $substrate.sav$ is a suitability index relative to fine substrate and $fines_{per}$ is the percent of fine substrate (silt and clay).


Light availability drives photosynthesis in SAV. Light attenuates within the water column based on depth and water clarity (i.e., the deeper and more turbid the water, the less light reaches the bottom). For the ESM, light availability depends on depth and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and is calculated algorithmically, then converted into a suitability index. Light availability (Iz) at the plant surface is estimated based on @van_nes_charisma_2003 is calculated in Equations 34-35 as follows: 

$$I_{z} = PAR * exp(-K_{d}*z)$$ 

where $PAR$ represents the photosynthetically active radiation at the surface, $K_{d}$ is the light attenuation coefficient for water clarity matching the conditions of the study site, and $z$ is water depth. 

Light at the plant surface is converted to a percent of light available at that depth, which is used to calculate a suitability score. 

$$PLW = \frac{I_{z}}{PAR} * 100$$ 

The relationship between Percent light available (PLA) and its suitability index for SAV is represented as follows:

$$light = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0 & PLA<10\\
0.0833*PLA-0.83 & PLA>70\\
1.0 & PLA>22\\
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $light$ is a suitability index relative to light penetration and $vessel.density$ is a suitability index relative to boat traffic and human uses.


Human-mediated disturbances (e.g., urban development, increased vessel traffic, etc.) can negatively impact SAV abundance. We quantify these disturbances through a proxy of vessel traffic per area. Vessel traffic is obtained from the Automatic Identification System database. Lower traffic (less than 10 tracks per year) is optimal and the suitability decreases with increasing vessel traffic. Suitability scores for are quantified as follows: 

$$vessel.density = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & ves_{AIS}=0-1\\
-0.0556*ves_{AIS}+1.06 & ves_{AIS}=1-10\\
-0.00556*ves_{AIS}+0.56 & ves_{AIS}=10-100\\
0.0 & ves_{AIS}>100
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $vessel.density$ is a suitability index relative to ship traffic and $ves_{AIS}$ is the vessel density from the Automated Information System.


#### Hard Clam Module

The clam habitat suitability submodel is based on _Thompson et al. (2021)_. Ideal depth for hard clams has been reported as 4 to 8 m, however hard clams can be found in shallower depths, but the habitat is considered suboptimal. This submodel consists of three variables (1) salinity, (2) substrate, and (3) SAV suitability. 

$I_{clam} = \frac{salinity.clam + substrate.clam + sav.prob}{4}$ 

Where $I_{clam}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to hard clam habitat, $salinity.clam$ is a suitability index relative to salinity, $substrate.clam$ is a suitability index relative to fine substrate, and $sav.prob$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation coverage. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal.

```

Salinity represents the range of salinities over which clams can survive. Optimal salinity for hard clams ranges from 25 to 35 psu. Hyper- and hypo-saline conditions (> 45 or <12.5 psu, respectively) are considered unsuitable when clams are exposed to these conditions for three to six consecutive days. Habitat suitability increases with increasing salinity for intermediate values. The relationship between salinity and its suitability index is formulated as follows: 

$$salinity.clam = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0 & salinity.psu=0-12\\
0.5*salinity.psu-6.0 & salinity.psu=12-12.5\\
0.033*salinity.psu-0.17 & salinity.psu=12.5-20\\
0.1*salinity.psu-1.5 & salinity.psu=20-25\\
1.0 & salinity.psu=25-35\\
-0.1*salinity.psu+4.5 & salinity.psu=12.5-20\\
0.0 & salinity.psu>45
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $salinity.clam$ is a suitability index relative to salinity and $salinity.psu$ is mean annual salinity.

Similar to seagrass and oysters, substrate is a critical parameter for hard clam viability. Optimal substrate is shelly soft bottom. As the substrate composition increases in sand and/or mud, the substrate is less suitable for clams. Suitability scores for clam substrate are quantified as follows:

$$substrate.clam = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0083*sand_{per} & sand_{per}=0-30\\
0.0125*sand_{per}-0.13 & sand_{per}=30-70\\
0.0083*sand_{per}+0.17 & sand_{per}=70-100
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $substrate.clam$ is a suitability index relative to fine substrate and $sav.prob$ is sand composition of the substrate (%sand).

Optimal habitat for hard clams is sandy bottom without seagrass. As seagrass coverage increases, the suitability for clams decreases. As a proxy for seagrass coverage, we use the index of seagrass suitability ($I_{clam}$). The relationship between seagrass suitability and hard clam suitability is formulated as follows:

$$sav.prob = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & I_{sav}=0-0.2\\
-1.667*I_{sav}+1.33 & I_{sav}=0.2-0.8\\
0.0 & I_{sav}=0.8-1.0
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $sav.prob$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation coverage and $I_{clam}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation coverage.

#### Key Gaps in `est.sub.soft`

This model for soft bottom habitat omits some important variables and processes. Notably, temperature is not presently included but represents a crucial variable for both SAV and clams. 

- *Temperature for SAV*: Like all vascular plants, temperature is a major driver for SAV viability. At low temperatures, physiological processes are constrained, while metabolic temperature increases with higher temperatures (Staehr et al. 2011).At temperatures above optimal range for SAV, metabolic activity is significantly reduced or halted as a result of protein denaturation or inactivation [@atkin_thermal_2003];[@jensen_psi-k_2000].

- *Temperature for Clams*: Temperature for Clams: Water temperature can have significant impacts on hard clams. For future models, temperatures below biological zero (5Â°C) and above 33Â°C are likely unsuitable. Temperatures between 12.5Â°C and above 32Â°C range in suitability with optimal temperatures between 22.5Â°C and 30Â°C.
