## Marine, Subtidal Submodel (mar.sub) (I)

<span style="color: red;">McKay to continue writing.</span>


Marine, subtidal ecosystems include the areas of high salinity (> 30 psu) bracketed by tidal limits of the mean lower low water (MLLW) and 2m below Mean Tide Level (MTL). In the context of NYBEM, these systems tend to directly front the Atlantic Ocean as beaches or occur in high salinity zones near inlets. 

Figure XX presents a conceptual model of the marine, subtidal ecosystem. This nearshore ecosystem hosts a variety of species of management interest such as hard clams, winter flounder, and seagrasses. As such, this model generally centers on the pelagic systems, submerged aquatic vegetation, and the benthic system. In general, coastal storm risk management actions are more likely to have direct effects on this ecosystem (e.g., footprint of constructed storm surge barriers) than indirect, offsite concerns more common in the estuarine systems.


![*Conceptual model for the marine, intertidal submodel.*](ZZ_Fig09_Mar.Sub_ConModel.png)

The tension between human uses of this landscape and ecological outcomes has long been acknowledged, and many models have been developed to assess ecological outcomes in marine, subtidal zones of the region. This submodel drew heavily from three primary bodies of knowledge, specifically:

* NY/NJ harbor mitigation functional assessment models (USACE 2000).  
* Habitat suitability models for winter flounder (USFWS 2001) and hard clam (Mulholland 1984).  
* Regional monitoring data associated with NY/NJ Harbor Deepening (USACE 2012, USACE 2015a, USACE 2015b), essential fish habitat mapping (USACE 2013), and water quality data for the lower bay (DEP 2018, USACE 2015b).


Four main classes of processes and dynamics were identified from a review of these models and studies: substrate-driven habitat use, physical currents and mixing, light penetration, and human uses of the system. From these processes, four surrogate metrics were identified, which collectively reflect the condition of the marine, subtidal zone. The sections below describe each metric and the rationale in detail, but briefly:

* Current velocity is a major driver of sediment dynamics as well as water quality processes.  
* Fine substrate affects utilization of habitats by a variety of taxa.  
* Light penetration is a proxy for both water quality outcomes and potential for SAV growth.  
* Human use intensity was summarized relative to vessel traffic density.  


The overall habitat suitability of the marine, subtidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these four metrics.


$I_{mar.sub} = \frac{velocity + substrate + light + vessel.density}{4}$ 

Where $I_{mar.sub}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the marine subtidal zone, $velocity$ is a suitability index relative to beach slope, $substrate$ is a suitability index relative to fine substrate, $light$ is a suitability index relative to light penetration, and $vessel.density$ is a suitability index relative to boat traffic and human uses. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal.
