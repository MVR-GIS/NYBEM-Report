#  Application and Communication

The NYBEM has been explicitly designed to inform site screening and environmental impact assessment for the NJBB and HATS. A key component of this process is understanding the existing condition without project effects. This section presents a preliminary application of the NYBEM to assess ecosystem condition in the New Jersey Back Bays following four main activities:  

- Collection of hydrodynamic model outcomes,  
- Compilation of other environmental input data sets,  
- Execution of the models, and  
- Summary of model outcomes.


## NJBB Hydrodynamic Modeling

Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) is the numerical model code applied for hydrodynamic simulations in this study of the New Jersey Back Bays. For this study, the two-dimensional (2D) shallow water module of AdH is applied for all simulations. This code solves for depth-averaged velocity and salinity throughout the model domain. (More details of the 2D shallow water module of AdH and its computational philosophy and equations are available in Savant et al. 2014 and Savant and Berger 2015.) AdH version 4.6 was applied for this study.

A 2D AdH model was developed and validated for simulation of hydrodynamics and salinity (Details provided in McAlpin and Ross, _draft_). The model was validated to available field data for all parameters . A field data collection effort was performed in February 2019 to collect salinity and discharge/velocity data over a 13-hour tidal cycle at three major inlets â€“ Barnegat, Little Egg, and Great Egg. Field data supported the use of a 2D model as opposed to a three-dimensional (3D) model due to lack of major salinity stratification.

The model domain was determined using aerial images and bathymetry/topographic data for the area. The Surface Water Modeling System was used to generate a 2D surface mesh and define material regions for applying specific model features, such as bed roughness. The domain is defined horizontally in Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 18 coordinates with units of meters. Vertically it is based on North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) with units of meters. All data applied to the model are shifted to this datum and coordinate system. Bathymetry data for the model were obtained from several sources: the Coastal Relief Model, sponsor collected hydrographic surveys, and the National Elevation Dataset. These data sets were combined such that the latest data were made a priority as well as data collected at finer resolution. The 2D AdH code can include areas that wet/dry; therefore, elevations were included in the domain up to 2 m NAVD88.

The model domain includes over 9,867 square miles, extending approximately 115 miles along the New Jersey Atlantic Ocean coastline from Lewes, DE, to Manasquan, NJ. The 2D mesh contains 324,881 elements and 165,514 nodes. Figure 6.1 shows horizontal node resolution for the model with an example region surrounding the Barnegat Bay Inlet. Resolution is finest in the small wetland channels to accurately capture the conveyance of flow in these areas as well as the salinity that migrates upstream in deeper channels. Finer resolution is also seen in areas where geometric features need to be defined accurately, such as in the inlets and around jetties. Ten AdH simulations were executed: seven project alternatives and three projects rerun with sea level change. However, only the existing condition scenario is presented here.

AdH was executed for a "base" condition representing 2018. For all simulations, the models output the following variables:  

- Bed elevation  
- Water surface elevations: mean lower low water (MLLW), mean tide level (MTL), mean higher high water (MHHW), and 0 to 100% exceedance by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record)  
- Salinity levels: mean annual and 0 to 100% exceedance by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record)  
- Velocity: mean annual and 0 to 100% exceedance by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record)

Shoreline Armoring data layer is a linear dataset developed by NOAA Office of Response and Restoration.   The layer represents linear areas of the coastal shoreline that are armored (ie. solid-man-made structures, riprap, boulder rubble) in 2014 (NJ) and 2016 (NY) as defined by the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) guidelines to be used in the preparation, evaluation, and/or response to threats to the coastal environment such as oil spills. The shoreline was delineated at mean higher high water (MHHW) using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and high resolution digital orthophotography datasets.

Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) vessel traffic density raster dataset was generated by the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, NOAA Office for Coastal Management from AIS Marine Cadastral data. This layer represents 2019 annual vessel transit counts of all vessels (i.e. commercial, recreational) summarized at a 100 m by 100 m pixel cell resolution. A single vessel transit is counted each time a vessel track passes through, starts, or stops within a 100 m grid cell.  Dataset name:  AISVesselTransitCounts2019_allvessels_clipINT.tif 


## Model Execution

Insert text describing any backend data prep stuff people need to know (e.g., the rasterization of data sets, coordinate systems, and any numerical magic).

Something about habitat delineation like the following...Bed elevation, water surface elevation (MHHW and MLLW), and salinity were input to the zonation functions shown in the Quantification section of this report. Figure 6.2 shows representative outputs from these functions for salinity and tidal zones as well as habitat types in the Barnegat Bay Inlet and Absecon Inlet. Notably, these habitat zones represent only AdH outputs and do not necessarily reflect regulatory definitions of ecosystems. For instance, an area identified as an estuarine, subtidal ecosystem may (or may not) currently host submerged aquatic vegetation or hard-bottom reef environments, which would imply very different outcomes from a management perspective. Likewise, an estuarine, intertidal zone may currently be developed and non-functional from an ecological perspective. However, these outputs provide broad spatial coverage not feasible to collect for the entire study area.

Talk about habitat quality calculations for the est.int model. This is just an example for one ecosystem type to give readers a feel for nybem outputs. 

<span style="color: red;">FIGURE 6.3. A six-panel figure showing: suitability indices for the 5 input variables and the overarching HSI. Same site and zoom as Figure 6.2. The figure should show no data (e.g., no fill) for non-est.int areas and a color gradient for the est.int areas. All maps and suitability indices should be scaled from 0 to 1 for consistency.</span>

Insert a comment summarizing this application and pointing to the need for post-processing outcomes in any application (e.g., into maps, tables, and summary stats tailored to the simulation at hand).
