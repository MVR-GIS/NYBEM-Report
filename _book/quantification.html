<p>The quantification phase of ecological model development formalizes a conceptual model in terms of mathematical relationships, model parameters, and a numerical algorithm <span class="citation">(Grant and Swannack 2008)</span>. This chapter describes the NYBEM relative to model structure, associated numerical tools, and the theoretical underpinnings of the sub-models. In general, the overarching quantitative architecture of the NYBEM can be summarized in three major elements (Figure 4.1). First, model inputs are assembled in a geospatial database. Second, the model code is prepared as a “package” in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R Statistical Software</a>. Finally, the model outputs habitat quantity and quality as well as habitat units for each patch in the model domain.</p>

<p>Input variables to NYBEM consist of three major groups of data layers. First, the spatial extent of a given model run must be defined. The NYBEM is constrained to applications within the region of the New York Bight watersheds (Section 2.1). Within that region, a focal area for the simulation must be specified, which can consist of a particular project boundary (e.g., NJBB or HATS) or a user-specified domain (e.g., a particular back bay). Within that focal area, the downstream and upstream extents of the model are specified based on the 20m ocean depth contour and Mean Higher High Water (MHHW), respectively. The second major group of variables consists of hydrodynamic inputs. These inputs may be computed for varying temporal windows (e.g., a month, a year, or a decade) depending on the project focus, and the inputs could be provided by a variety of hydrodynamic models or empirical data sources. Hydrodynamic variables characterize the bed elevation, water surface, salinity, and current velocity distributed throughout the project area. Third, a variety of environmental variables are compiled from national and regional data sets to inform habitat quality calculations.</p>
<p>All model code for the NYBEM is contained within an R-package (<code>nybem</code>, <a href="https://github.com/MVR-GIS">available via github</a>). Generally speaking, a package can be thought of as a fundamental unit of code that can include functions, data, documentation, and tests (<a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">Wickham and Bryan 2019</a>). Packages then provide a transportable and reproducible mechanism for code sharing and publication. The <code>nybem</code> package contains nine functions and associated testing trials. This chapter describes each function in detail, but they can be summarized briefly as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>nybem.domain</code>: This function defines the model domain based on the regional extent of the New York Bight watersheds, a user-specified focal area, a downstream extent of a 20m ocean depth contour, and an upstream extent based on bed elevations less than MHHW.</p></li>
<li><p><code>patch.mapper</code>: This function maps the extent of NYBEM’s six major ecosystem types (Table 3.2) based on user-specified data layers for bed elevation, MLLW, MTL, MHHW, and salinity.</p></li>
<li><p><code>patch.rasterizer</code>: This function rasterizes the output of <code>patch.mapper</code> based on a specified grid resolution and aligns that layer with a specified spatial coordinate system.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fre.tid</code>: This function computes habitat quality for any freshwater, tidal patches.</p></li>
<li><p><code>est.int</code>: This function computes habitat quality for any estuarine, intertidal patches.</p></li>
<li><p><code>est.sub</code>: This function computes habitat quality for any estuarine, subtidal patches.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mar.int</code>: This function computes habitat quality for any marine, intertidal patches.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mar.sub</code>: This function computes habitat quality for any marine, subtidal patches.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mar.deep</code>: This function computes habitat quality for any marine, deepwater patches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first three functions can largely be thought of as fundamentally pre-processing the input data and mapping the extent of the six ecosystem types. For purposes of model development, these are relatively straight-forward and will be documented collectively. The latter six functions each compute a 0 to 1 metric of ecosystem condition (i.e., habitat quality) based on a unique set of input variables, equations, and parameters.</p>
<p>Each of these habitat quality sub-models followed a consistent set of development steps, which are documented throughout this chapter and briefly describe here. Preliminary variables were identified at a series of interagency workshops through a series of conceptual modeling exercises (Appendix A). Additional variables were added based on taxa-specific habitat suitability models (i.e., USFWS “blue books”), relevant tools (e.g., New England Marsh Model), and literature reviews. A conceptual model was then developed for each ecosystem type to better understand how key variables relate and influence each other. An overarching list of regional and national data sets were also compiled to ensure that model variables could be assessed throughout the broad spatial extent of the New York Bight. Potential model variables were compiled along with the rationale for inclusion or exclusion. Finally, a numerical “suitability index” was developed for each variable remaining in the sub-model, which were based on existing suitability indices, published thresholds / responses, and professional judgment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the <code>nybem</code> allows users to assess the extent and integrity of the six major ecosystem types represented in the NYBEM. The size and quality of a given habitat patch can provide useful metrics in their own right, or they may be summarized as an overarching “habitat unit” (i.e., the quantity of habitat in acres * patch quality assessed on a 0 to 1 scale).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Habitat Zonation<a href="quantification.html#habitat-zonation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><code>patch.mapper</code>: This function maps the extent of NYBEM’s six major ecosystem types (Table 3.2) based on user-specified data layers for bed elevation, MLLW, MTL, MHHW, and salinity.</p>
<p>In NYBEM, the quantity and quality of each ecosystem type may be assessed separately. For instance, ecosystems could be rapidly delineated from empirical data for the existing condition (e.g., field or tide gauge) or modeled hydrodynamic data for future conditions or proposed management actions. These delineated ecosystems can be summarized as an overarching habitat quantity in acres. Ecosystem quality may then be assessed based on patch-specific data and known thresholds in ecological response (e.g., on a normalized 0 to 1 scale indicating ecological quality or function). The product of habitat quality and quantity provides a consistent metric across ecosystem types (i.e., “habitat units”). Here, the terms “habitat” and “ecosystem” are used synonymously to indicate a given patch.</p>
<p>The criteria for delineating ecosystems (Table 3) were subsequently programmed as a suite of logic statements for identifying the salinity zone, tidal zone, or ecosystem / habitat type for any given patch. The following functions input salinity, bed elevation, mean lower low water (MLLW), and mean higher high water (MHHW), and output a numerical code indicating salinity, tidal, and habitat zone as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tidal Zone</em>: 1 = deep, 2 = subtidal, 3 = intertidal, and 4 = upland</li>
<li><em>Salinity Zone</em>: 1 = marine, 2 = estuarine, or 3 = freshwater<br />
</li>
<li><em>Habitat Zone / Ecosystem Type</em>: 1 = upland, 2 = marine, deepwater, 3 = marine, subtidal, 4 = marine, intertidal, 5 = estuarine subtidal, 6 = estuarine intertidal, or 7 = freshwater</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Freshwater, Tidal Zone<a href="quantification.html#freshwater-tidal-zone" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Freshwater marshes are found in the topmost region of the estuary zone, from New York to North Carolina, where the entry of saltwater from tidal action is mitigated by a significantly higher amount of freshwater from upstream. These unique environments are ideally developed from sediments deposited by inflows from major freshwater rivers. Salt concentrations in tidal freshwater are typically less than 0.5 psu, although larger salinity pulses can occur during spring tides or periods of extremely low river discharge.</p>
<p>Tidal freshwater marshes provide significant nesting sites for a variety of species, including the marsh wren, and offer the primary habitat for emergent aquatic plants. Chronic sea-level rise is pushing the salt gradient upstream in rivers around the Atlantic Coast, causing vegetation to shift and some tidal freshwater marshes to become oligohaline wetlands. Many migratory (diadromous) fish species also rely on this habitat system, which is characterized by tidally impacted freshwater systems <span class="citation">(Pasternack, Hilgartner, and Brush 2000)</span>. Mussels, sturgeon, herring, and marsh wren are some of the species that live in this zone along with many micro-organisms.</p>
<p>The ability for the tidal freshwater ecosystem to support these various organisms can be modeled using salinity, vegetation coverage, episodic sediment deposition, and edge accretion parameters. Salinity concentration influences many chemical and physical ecological processes within the tidal freshwater ecosystem and supports euryhaline organisms. Emergent vegetation coverage provides habitat, mitigates inland flooding, and supports water quality within the tidal freshwater ecosystem. Water depth fluctuations support sediment deposition that bring an influx of organic nutrients into the ecosystem and mitigates sea-level rise. These quantifiable parameters all have influences on ecosystem services and habitat suitability within a tidal freshwater ecosystem.</p>
<p>Figure 4.2 presents a conceptual model of the freshwater, tidal ecosystem. This ecosystem is strongly influenced by effects on marsh elevations, salinity regimes, and the role of the system as a migratory corridor.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Salinity<a href="quantification.html#salinity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Freshwater tidal wetlands are marshes and swamps with water that is less saline than brackish and is flooded on a regular lunar tidal basis. The salinity of the water varies from oligohaline to totally fresh (0 psu to 0.5 psu).</p>
<p>Salinity influences physical and chemical processes such as flocculation and the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, as well as the types of organisms that reside in a freshwater tidal ecosystem. Hurricanes and other storms may bring brackish water into the system, which is a significant natural disturbance. Because many plant species in these wetlands are not tolerant to brackish conditions, much of the vegetation is harmed as a result of these occurrences. For NYBEM, a proxy variable is used to account for these processes.</p>
<p>For NYBEM, the salinity regime is summarized through a metric of the percent of time salinity is less than the freshwater tidal ecosystem threshold of 0.5 psu. This approach assumes that saltwater inputs serve as disturbance on the ecosystem, and lower levels of salinity are preferred. Depth-averaged salinity is computed or measured at small time steps over and annual timeframe. These data may then be summarized as an “exceedence curve” with thresholds from 0-100% in 10% intervals. For NYBEM, this exceedence curve is used to calculate the percent of time salinity is less than or equal to 0.5 psu.</p>
<p><em>Please check equation</em>
This duration metric is then translated into a suitability metric as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[salinity.high.dur = \begin{pmatrix} 0.05*sal_{dur} &amp; sal_{dur}=0-20\\
1.0 &amp; sal_{dur}=20-100
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(salinity.high.dur\)</span> is a suitability index relative to high salinity periods and <span class="math inline">\(sal_{dur}\)</span> is the percent of time salinity is greater than the threshold for freshwater tidal habitat (i.e., salinity &gt; 0.5 psu).</p>

<div id="vegetation-coverage" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Vegetation Coverage<a href="quantification.html#vegetation-coverage" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Freshwater Tidal Marshes are characterized by the dominance of herbaceous, shrubby, or emergent aquatic vegetation, with only a slight canopy of trees. Emergent vegetation coverage plays a crucial role in the tidal freshwater ecosystem. For avian taxa like the marsh wren, cover/reproduction appropriateness must be determined by the relative availability of emergent plants for nesting marsh wrens (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). Microorganisms frequently occupy headwaters marshes because they are contiguous with tidal creeks and contain an abundance of emergent vegetation <span class="citation">(Rozas and Odum 1988)</span>.</p>
<p>Vegetation coverage within a freshwater marsh provides crucial habitat to a variety of unique animals and organisms. Vegetation within a tidal freshwater marsh is mainly brackish and cannot withstand long periods of increased salinity (over 0.5 ppt). Further, excessively moist or dry periods can cause additional stress to vegetation leaving the habitat susceptible to a salt intrusion event which can destroy vegetation and make the habitat totally unsuitable.</p>
<p>For the NYBEM tidal freshwater ecosystem submodel, vegetation coverage is quantified as the percentage of emergent aquatic vegetation. Emergent aquatic vegetation is a key habitat resource for species found within this ecosystem like marsh wren. Marsh wren are a key indicator species of ecosystem health because they are drawn to ideal wetland conditions. These important avian taxa are highly territorial and have a minimum habitat area of 50% emergent vegetation coverage <span class="citation">(Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987)</span>. Marsh wrens rarely breed in marshes with less than 57% emergent vegetation <span class="citation">(Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987)</span>. As a result, if there is less than this quantity of wetland habitat (emergent vegetation), the HSI is presumed to be 0. Vegetation coverage is a vital parameter of habitat suitability within a tidal freshwater ecosystem.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[veg.cover = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; cover_{per}=0-50\\

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Episodic Sediment Deposition<a href="quantification.html#episodic-sediment-deposition" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Tidal oscillations control the short-term dynamics of freshwater tidal wetlands, which feed nutrients into the environment and make them more fruitful and productive than most non-tidal wetlands (<span class="citation">Propato, Clough, and Polaczyk (2018)</span>). These tidal oscillations, as well as irregular weather events, deposit sediment and nutrients into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Increased inundation in tidal freshwater marshes leads to more inorganic sediment deposition, which can assist tidal wetlands keep up with rising sea levels. As a result, marshes can migrate vertically to preserve their position in the tidal frame to some extent. In contrast, tidal freshwater ecosystems are frequently coupled with complicated geometry, such as a meandering channel with uneven depths and cross-sections. Because of the complicated geometry and huge fluctuations in freshwater discharge, there are strong seasonal variations in depth, which affect pollution transfer and algae development. When the depth of water within the ecosystem increases, the system is more susceptible to HABs, pollution, and habitat degradation. As a relative output of sediment, we adopt the ratio of water depth ranges to the tidal range, which we calculate as follows:</p>
<p><em>Please check equation</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d_{rel} = \frac{H_{max} - H_{min}}{Hmedian}\]</span>
Where <span class="math inline">\(d_{rel}\)</span> is water depth relative to the minimum and maximum water height measurements, <span class="math inline">\(H_{max}\)</span> is the maximum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, <span class="math inline">\(H_{min}\)</span> is the minimum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, and <span class="math inline">\(H_{median}\)</span> is the median depth observed over a hydrodynamic stimulation period.</p>
<p>The relationship between sediment deposition and water level rise can be used to quantify habitat suitability within the freshwater tidal ecosystem. When water level increases, sediment deposition will be at an optimal level to support freshwater tidal habitat. This metric provides a relative accounting for the variances in depth across the ecosystem. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(d_{rel}&gt;1\)</span> occurs in portions of the freshwater tidal ecosystem that experience optimal sediment deposition conditions less than 90% exceedance from <span class="math inline">\(H_{median}\)</span>, and in portions of the freshwater tidal ecosystem that experience optimal sediment deposition conditions less than 10% exceedance from <span class="math inline">\(H_{median}\)</span>. In terms of habitat suitability, we assume that ideal values of this metric occur around 0.5 (near 1.1 meter depth) and suitability declines on either side of this threshold as follows:</p>
<p><em>Please check equation</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[deposition = \begin{pmatrix} 0.02*d_{rel} &amp; d_{rel}&lt;0.5\\
-0.02*d_{rel}+2 &amp; d_{rel}&gt;0.5\\

\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>

<p>Edge Accretion: Edge accretion remains an important parameter of habitat suitability within the freshwater tidal ecosystem to include in the future development of the NYBEM. Freshwater tidal ecosystems have survived despite a rise in sea level, with tidal marsh heights remaining constant under freshwater circumstances, but future anticipated increases in relative sea-level rise might outpace marsh accretion rates, potentially resulting in the loss of these elevation-dependent coastal ecosystems (<span class="citation">Schile et al. (2014)</span>). Accretion is characterized as the accumulation of plant material, including roots and degraded material, from plants growing in the marsh, as well as growth via deposition of suspended particles during floods (allochthonous growth) (autochthonous growth)(<span class="citation">Schile et al. (2014)</span>).
In the SLAMM model, marsh erosion is exclusively modeled at the marsh-to-open-water interface, and erosion occurs only if fetch is sufficient. As a result, marshes have been proven to be less sensitive to this parameter than accretion parameters (MEM)(SLAMM)(<span class="citation">Morris et al. (2002)</span>;<span class="citation">Propato, Clough, and Polaczyk (2018)</span>). Edge Accretion can be quantified using parameters in marsh platform elevation, biomass increase, and tidal inundation, but face limitations from data availability and accessibility.</p>

<p>Estuarine environments include marine water that has been diluted by freshwater runoff from the land <span class="citation">(Prosser et al. 2018)</span>. Due to tidal influence, intertidal ecosystems are found between high and low tide, experiencing varying land and sea influences, whereas subtidal ecosystems are constantly submerged. The estuarine intertidal ecosystem considers areas with salinity values greater than 0.5 psu to 30 psu and elevation from MHHW to MLLW. Plant, animal, and microorganism populations, as well as their nonliving surroundings, interact as a working unit in intertidal ecosystems, which are exposed at low tides (Citation). Within the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, ecological processes are linked to physical and chemical characteristics. These characteristics can experience change under anthropogenic and climatic pressures that deviate from the homeostasis, or baseline, habitat condition. This can result in reduced habitat suitability across the estuarine intertidal ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tidal marshes are vegetated intertidal ecosystems found at the land-sea interface that serve as crucial transition zones for marine, freshwater, and terrestrial processes <span class="citation">(Colombano et al. 2021)</span>. Tidal marshes originated in a range of coastal and estuarine environments, and their location exposes them to a number of environmental factors (e.g., ocean currents, watershed hydrology) and environmental gradients (e.g., salinity)<span class="citation">(Lauchlan and Nagelkerken 2020)</span>. Broad-scale climatic changes are already affecting the timing, size, and duration of naturally varying environmental variables in estuarine, and freshwater settings. Understanding the changes in environmental stressors from climate change and sea level rise (SLR) on the tidal marsh ecosystem is critical to evaluate changes after the addition of storm surge barriers.</p>
<p>The following variables are accessible to the estuarine intertidal submodel portion of the NYBEM: salinity, episodic sediment deposition, edge erosion, vegetative cover, development of adjacent uplands, and the presence/absence of shoreline armoring.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Salinity<a href="quantification.html#salinity-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Salinity has an impact on physical and chemical processes including flocculation and the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, as well as the kinds of organisms that can live in an estuary. Estuarine organisms have evolved to cope with salinity fluctuations. Those that prefer fresher water at the upstream river end of the estuary to species that prefer saltier water at the downstream sea end usually form a gradient. Estuarine plants and animals suffer when extremely high salinities persist for lengthy periods of time. During instances of heavy freshwater inflows from rivers, harm might also occur. Extreme events are the issue in both scenarios.</p>
<p>Higher salinity, lower nutrient intake, and lower sediment inputs, that are associated with extremely low river inflow, can stress or kill plants and animals, limit productivity (owing to nutritional deficiency), and destroy marshes due to low sediment input. Low estuary salinity kills marine creatures when river inflow is extremely high; while excessive nutrient inputs contribute to algae blooms; and increased sediment input suffocates sea grasses and oysters <span class="citation">(Hopkinson et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>For NYBEM, the salinity regime is represented by a percentage of time where salinity is less than 30 psu, the estuarine intertidal ecological threshold. Freshwater inputs are assumed to be a disruption to the environment, and moderate salinity levels are recommended (less than 30 psu). Over an annual timescale, depth-averaged salinity is estimated or measured at short time steps. The data can then be summarized as a “exceedence curve,” with thresholds ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments. The percent of time that salinity is less than or equal to 30 psu is calculated using this exceedence curve in NYBEM.</p>
<p>This duration metric is then translated into a suitability metric as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Edge Erosion<a href="quantification.html#edge-erosion" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Climate change, pollution, and other anthropogenic effects are putting more pressure on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Coastal flooding and shoreline erosion will likely become more common as sea levels rise and storm surges shift as a result of climate change. There is fear that tidal wetlands will drown as sea levels rise and sediment supplies to the shore decline across the world. Marsh sediment budgets are a geographically integrated measure of opposing constructive and destructive forces: a surplus of sediment can lead to vertical growth and/or lateral expansion, while a shortfall can lead to drowning and/or lateral contraction <span class="citation">(Ganju et al. 2017)</span>. Many estuarine marshes face sediment deficits along the shoreline as a result of increased edge erosion. Edge degradation causes morphological changes that make it easier for waves to propagate to the marsh borders and promote the resuspension and export of sediments from the estuary <span class="citation">(Li, Leonardi, and Plater 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>The percent change in edge erosion throughout the estuarine intertidal ecosystem is used to represent habitat suitability. When the percentage of shear stress for erosion is 10% or greater, erosion occurs, resulting in a reduction in total marsh area and an increase in open water area. At a rate of 30% shear stress from erosion, the habitat will no longer be suitable (habitat suitability equals zero.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Vegetation Cover<a href="quantification.html#vegetation-cover" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Vegetation provides various ecological services within the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, including providing a fish nursery environment, feed for migratory birds, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and sediment stability. Therefore reductions of vegetative cover can have a significant impact on shallow marine ecosystems. Seagrass meadows are disappearing at an alarming rate in shallow coastal and estuary marine environments, with losses similar to tropical rainforests, mangroves, and coral reefs due to anthropogenic and climate stress <span class="citation">(Walter et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The loss of vegetative cover changes the dynamics near the seabed in locations where there was formerly vegetation. This loss transforms huge areas of the estuary from a deposition and accretion-friendly environment to one that favors suspension and erosion.

<p>Estuaries are efficient sediment traps. Near-bottom circulation causes sediment flow convergence during the transition from brackish to fresh water, resulting in local maxima in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and deposition rates. Marine materials are deposited from the continental shelf into estuarine habitats. Due to disparities in tidal currents (ebb versus flood tide), sediments are carried to supply sediment on varying time frames. In the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, sediment transport capacity is mostly determined by river discharge, by the timing of discharge events in relation to the spring–neap cycle, and subtidal oscillations in sea level <span class="citation">(Prosser et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Due to the retreat of the salinity intrusion and increasing bed pressures, sediment deposition episodes can induce considerable bed resuspension in the estuary. Periodic flood and storm events are major drivers in sediment dynamics and contribute disproportionately to the total sediment discharge <span class="citation">(Ralston et al. 2013)</span>. During these episodes of retreating salinity intrusions and increasing bed pressures, sediment deposition episodes can induce considerable bed resuspension in the estuary. The duration of high-discharge episodes in relation to the estuarine reaction time, a feature that fluctuates seasonally with discharge and estuarine length, also affects sediment transport capacity <span class="citation">(Palinkas et al. 2014)</span>. These short-term events can cause changes in the local biological community and affect seabed stability and strength. As a relative output of sediment, we adopt the ratio of water depth ranges to the tidal range, which we calculate as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d_{rel} = \frac{H_{max} - H_{min}}{Hmedian}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(d_{rel}\)</span> is water depth relative to the minimum and maximum water height measurements, <span class="math inline">\(H_{max}\)</span> is the maximum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, <span class="math inline">\(H_{min}\)</span> is the minimum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, and <span class="math inline">\(H_{median}\)</span> is the median depth observed over a hydrodynamic stimulation period.</p>
<p>These then affect sediment mixing and activation, as well as tides, which affect water infiltration and exfiltration through the sediment <span class="citation">(Nancy Jackson, Karl Nordstorm, and David R. Smith 2010)</span>. During storms, erosion of the shoreline can result in the removal of material from the upper foreshore and deposition on the lower foreshore, or the foreshore moving horizontally landward. In coastal and estuary environments across the world, harmful algal blooms (HABs) have substantial economic, public health, and ecological consequences. The influx of additional nutrients following an episode of sediment deposition have been known to cause harmful algal blooms (HABs)<span class="citation">(Ralston et al. 2014)</span>. Further, the frequent upturn of sediment can displace biological organisms. For example, horseshoe crabs are significantly affected by the above mentioned foreshore processes caused by episodic storms.</p>
<p>The relationship between sediment deposition and water level rise can be used to quantify habitat suitability within the esturarine intertidal ecosystem. When water level increases, sediment deposition will be at an optimal level to support esturarine intertidal habitat. This metric provides a relative accounting for the variances in depth across the ecosystem. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(d_{rel}&gt;1\)</span> occurs in portions of the esturarine intertidal ecosystem that experience optimal sediment deposition conditions less than 90% exceedance from <span class="math inline">\(H_{median}\)</span>, and in portions of the esturarine intertidal ecosystem that experience optimal sediment deposition conditions less than 10% exceedance from <span class="math inline">\(H_{median}\)</span>. In terms of habitat suitability, we assume that ideal values of this metric occur around 0.5 (near 1.1 meter depth) and suitability declines on either side of this threshold as follows:</p>
<p><em>Please check equation</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[deposition = \begin{pmatrix} 0.02*d_{rel} &amp; d_{rel}&lt;0.5\\

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> Developement of Adjacent Upland<a href="quantification.html#developement-of-adjacent-upland" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The development of uplands within a watershed can have a direct and indirect impact on a variety of essential aspects in estuarine intertidal ecosystems. The combination of coastal erosion and upland development causes a “coastal squeeze,” in which low-lying, intertidal regions, that would usually recede inland in the face of sea-level rise, are diminished because man-made structures (e.g. shoreline armoring) prevent such retreat <span class="citation">(Prosser et al. 2018)</span>. This means that tidal marshes will need to shift upslope onto nearby uplands to survive during a period of rapid sea-level rise. Land management methods on the tidal marsh’s upland border can help or hinder ecosystem migration in response to increasing sea levels <span class="citation">(Anisfeld, Cooper, and Kemp 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Both developed and undeveloped uplands can experience ecological stress as a result of climate change and land use changes (e.g. addition of storm surge barriers, shoreline armoring). Climate change’s effects on ocean and watershed systems are intertwined and set to interact.This is especially true in tidal marshes, which are biogenic environments that are sculpted by tidal and fluvial processes, and are dynamic and architecturally complex <span class="citation">(Colombano et al. 2021)</span>. Multiple stressors can affect the development of adjacent uplands such as low-flows, flooding, and reduced stream continuity <span class="citation">(Talke and Jay 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>For the NYBEM, habitat suitability is modeled for an increase in development for adjacent uplands. When the percentage of developed adjacent uplands is greater than 10%, habitat suitability in the estuarine intertidal ecosystem declines. When the development of adjacent upland reaches 100% of the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, the habitat will no longer be considered suitable.</p>

<p>Natural biological processes and human-induced changes to the estuarine intertidal shoreline boundary are considered as components to a complex ecological system. The mean high-tide line is commonly used to determine shoreline boundaries and extent <span class="citation">(Kittinger and Ayers 2010)</span>. Shoreline modification called armoring has resulted in a considerable loss of coastal ecosystems from erosion, as well as a reduction in the resilience of these systems to disturbance <span class="citation">(Kittinger and Ayers 2010)</span>. Shoreline armoring involves placing hardened structures like bulkheads and revetments along the shoreline and as sea levels rise, these structures can prevent coastal marshes from spreading upland over time <span class="citation">(Gardner and Johnston 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Armoring is widespread throughout the United States, with extensive armoring found near urban areas <span class="citation">(Morley, Toft, and Hanson 2012)</span>. Shoreline armoring occupies 50-70% of shorelines along urban coastal areas <span class="citation">(Dugan et al. 2018)</span>. Increasing shoreline development pressure and predicted sea-level rise suggest that the demand for shoreline armoring will continue to rise and expand throughout the future <span class="citation">(Gardner and Johnston 2021)</span>. Shoreline armoring is correlated with decreased habitat complexity, and a reduction in connectivity to adjacent habitats <span class="citation">(Morley, Toft, and Hanson 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>The environmental consequences of armoring are context dependent, relying on characteristics of the environment and armoring structural factors <span class="citation">(Dugan et al. 2018)</span>. The type of structure placed (e.g., seawalls, bulkheads, revetments) and its relative placement on the coast profile will influence the biological reactions to armoring.

<p>This section presents development of the estuarine, subtidal submodel (est.sub). Estuarine subtidal habitat was defined as areas with elevations between MLLW and -20m with salinities ranging from 0.5 to 30 psu. In general, the est.sub seeks to capture the general condition and trajectory of the estuarine subtidal habitat using three different taxa (oysters, SAV, and clams) as indicators of ecosystem quality. Each taxa provides critical contributions to the overall quality of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>A conceptual model of the estuarine subtidal habitat was developed at a mediated modeling workshop (Appendix A). The conceptual model represented the major components affecting the quality of the ecosystem. Three main categories of drivers were identified: physical (water quality, velocity, sedimentation), anthropogenic (vessel traffic and development stress), and biological (SAV, benthic organisms, fish) with interactions among the categories. Conceptual models were then refined in two key ways (Figure XX). First, it was assumed that essential fish habitat would be present if oysters, SAV, and clams were present, so this variable was removed. Second, substrate type is a major driver of SAV, oysters, and clams. In general, the ecosystem can be coarsely divided into hard bottom and soft bottom habitats roughly correlated with oysters and SAV/clams, respectively. The unique characteristics and drivers of these habitats led to splitting the est.sub model into modules for each of these substrate types.</p>

<p>Oysters are a major indicator of the integrity of hard bottom habitats in the New York Bight, and the hard bottom submodel is represented by an <strong>adaptation</strong> of the Oyster Habitat Suitability Index Model (OHSIM <span class="citation">Swannack, Reif, and Soniat (2014)</span>). The OHSIM is a USACE-certified model for the Eastern oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>). OHSIM is a spatially-explicit, grid-based index model that uses a series of linear equations to calculate habitat suitability for <em>C. virginica</em>. The model consists of four variables: substrate and three measures of salinity – 1) mean salinity during spawning season, in which spawning and spat set have a higher optimal salinity than for survival of adults, 2) annual mean salinity, which is the expected range over which adult oysters are viable, and 3) minimum annual salinity, which defines the impacts of high mortality events resulting from lower salinities due to freshwater influxes <span class="citation">(Soniat et al. 2012)</span>. Variables are briefly described below, and more details can be found in <span class="citation">Swannack, Reif, and Soniat (2014)</span> and EcoPCX documentation.</p>
<p>For the NYBEM, spawning season salinity data were not available, so only three variables are used.

<p>Salinity represents the range of salinities over which clams can survive. Optimal salinity for hard clams ranges from 25 to 35 psu. Hyper- and hypo-saline conditions (&gt; 45 or &lt;12.5 psu, respectively) are considered unsuitable when clams are exposed to these conditions for three to six consecutive days. Habitat suitability increases with increasing salinity for intermediate values. The relationship between salinity and its suitability index is formulated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[salinity.clam = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; salinity.psu=0-12\\
0.5*salinity.psu-6.0 &amp; salinity.psu=12-12.5\\
0.033*salinity.psu-0.17 &amp; salinity.psu=12.5-20\\
0.1*salinity.psu-1.5 &amp; salinity.psu=20-25\\
1.0 &amp; salinity.psu=25-35\\

<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(salinity.clam\)</span> is a suitability index relative to salinity and <span class="math inline">\(salinity.psu\)</span> is mean annual salinity.</p>
<p>Similar to seagrass and oysters, substrate is a critical parameter for hard clam viability. Optimal substrate is shelly soft bottom. As the substrate composition increases in sand and/or mud, the substrate is less suitable for clams. Suitability scores for clam substrate are quantified as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[substrate.clam = \begin{pmatrix} 0.0083*sand_{per} &amp; sand_{per}=0-30\\
0.0125*sand_{per}-0.13 &amp; sand_{per}=30-70\\

<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(substrate.clam\)</span> is a suitability index relative to fine substrate and <span class="math inline">\(sav.prob\)</span> is sand composition of the substrate (%sand).</p>
<p>Optimal habitat for hard clams is sandy bottom without seagrass. As seagrass coverage increases, the suitability for clams decreases. As a proxy for seagrass coverage, we use the index of seagrass suitability (<span class="math inline">\(I_{clam}\)</span>). The relationship between seagrass suitability and hard clam suitability is formulated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[sav.prob = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; I_{sav}=0-0.2\\

<p>This model for soft bottom habitat omits some important variables and processes. Notably, temperature is not presently included but represents a crucial variable for both SAV and clams.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Temperature for SAV</em>: Like all vascular plants, temperature is a major driver for SAV viability.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Marine, Intertidal Zone<a href="quantification.html#marine-intertidal-zone" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Marine, intertidal ecosystems include the areas of high salinity (&gt; 30 psu) bracketed by tidal limits of the mean higher high water (MHHW) and mean lower low water (MLLW). In the context of NYBEM, these systems tend to directly front the Atlantic Ocean as beaches or occur in high salinity zones near inlets.</p>
<p>Figure XX presents a conceptual model of the marine, intertidal ecosystem. This nearshore ecosystem is strongly influenced by two major pressures, the physical drivers of the ocean environment (e.g., currents, sediment transport) and human uses of the system (e.g., beaches and associated upland development). Ecologically, this ecosystem hosts a variety of species of management interest such as seabeach amaranth, horseshoe crabs, shorebirds (e.g., piping plover, terns, red knot), and sea turtles.</p>
<p>Coastal storm risk management actions have the potential to affect this ecosystem through two primary mechanisms. First, some risk management actions (e.g., storm surge barriers) could be directly constructed in this area. Second, large-scale features have the potential to alter coastal dynamics indirectly, although this affect may occur to a lesser extent given the overarching dominance of ocean effects.</p>

<p>The tension between human uses of this landscape and ecological outcomes has long been acknowledged, and many models have been developed to assess ecological outcomes in marine, intertidal zones of the region. This submodel drew heavily from four general bodies of knowledge, specifically:</p>

</ul>
<p>Four classes of processes and dynamics were identified from a review of these models and studies: long-term and large-scale wave and sediment dynamics, beach morphology, benthic food supplies, and the role of this system as a corridor between aquatic and upland environments. From these processes, six surrogate metrics were identified, which collectively reflect the condition of the marine, intertidal zone. Notably, variables reflecting wave and sediment dynamics are minimally included in this phase of modeling due to assessment challenges. The sections below describe each metric and the rationale in detail, but briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beach slope was identified as a proxy for larger effects on overall morphology and grain size.</p></li>
<li><p>The proportion of time a beach is exposed provides a metric of benthic food supplies and availability of foraging habitat.</p></li>
<li><p>Upland land use intensity and shoreline armoring metrics describe the general human use pressures on a given system and viability of corridor functions.</p></li>
<li><p>A vegetation cover metric assesses the viability of the corridor relative to different taxa movement requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall habitat suitability of the marine, intertidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these six metrics.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I_{mar.int} = \frac{beach.slope + exp.dur + substrate + land.use + veg.cover + shoreline}{6}\)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Beach Slope<a href="quantification.html#beach-slope" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Beach morphology directly affects habitat use by multiple focal taxa (e.g., shorebirds, turtles, horseshoe crab). Beach shape and morphologic character can be described through parameters of width, slope, elevation, and other summaries of topography <span class="citation">(Bridges et al. 2015)</span>. Beach width is indirectly captured in NYBEM through metrics of habitat quantity and patch size and is not considered here. Beach slope integrates morphologic outcomes and is directly tied to grain size and wave environment <span class="citation">(Lodder et al. 2021)</span>. Beach slope, thus, provides an important and synthetic metric of marine, intertidal habitat quality.</p>
<p>Beach slope is identified as a general indicator of ecosystem condition for Long Island ecosystems (<span class="citation">USACE (2009)</span>), and as an important driving component of habitat use by multiple taxa in the New York Bight. For example, seabeach amaranth (<em>Amaranthus pumilus</em>) typically occurs in low slope environments <span class="citation">(Sellars and Jolls 2007)</span>), while habitat is most suitable for horseshoe crabs between ~5-10% slopes <span class="citation">(Brady and Schrading 1996)</span>. Notably, not all taxa may respond in kind to these generalization; for instance, sea turtles have shown habitat preferences for moderate slopes between ~10-30% in subtropical areas such as Southeastern Florida. Beach slope, thus, provides an important and synthetic metric of marine, intertidal habitat quality. Merging these regional models, NYBEM assesses suitability relative to beach slope as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[beach.slope = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; slope_{per}=0-10\\
-0.05*slope_{per}+1.5 &amp; slope_{per}=10-30\\
0.0 &amp; slope_{per}&gt;30
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(beach.slope\)</span> is a suitability index relative to beach slope and <span class="math inline">\(slope_{per}\)</span> is the slope of the beach perpendicular to the mean tide line in percent.</p>

<div id="exposure-duration" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Exposure Duration<a href="quantification.html#exposure-duration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Intertidal zones are a key foraging habitat for shorebirds. The benthic food availability is related in part to soil moisture <span class="citation">(Brady and Schrading 1996)</span> and the time to forage in these zones. Soil moisture is also a key determinant of horseshoe crab spawning <span class="citation">(Avissar 2006)</span>. For NYBEM, a proxy variable is used to account for these processes. Specifically, a ratio of depth ranges to the tidal range is used as a relative duration of exposure, which we calculate as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t_{rel} = \frac{H_{max} - H_{min}}{MHHW-MLLW}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(t_{rel}\)</span> is a relative duration of exposure, <span class="math inline">\(H_{max}\)</span> is the maximum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, <span class="math inline">\(H_{min}\)</span> is the minimum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, <span class="math inline">\(MHHW\)</span> is mean higher high water, and <span class="math inline">\(MLLW\)</span> is mean lower low water.</p>
<p>This metric provides a relative accounting for the amount of exposure a given path experiences. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(t_{rel}&gt;1\)</span> occurs in portions of the intertidal that remain underwater most of the time, and <span class="math inline">\(t_{rel}=0\)</span> occurs in areas where the elevation exceeds the intertidal range. In terms of habitat suitability, we assume that ideal values of this metric occur around 0.5 (near the mean tide level) and suitability declines on either side of this threshold as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[exp.dur = \begin{pmatrix} 0.02*t_{rel} &amp; t_{rel}&lt;0.5\\
-0.02*t_{rel}+2 &amp; t_{rel}&gt;0.5\\
0.0 &amp; t_{rel}&gt;1.0

<p>Marine, intertidal zones are a key transitional habitat between aquatic and upland systems. Fully functional intertidal areas would include high-quality adjacent uplands and subtidal areas. A variety of metrics have been used to assess human impacts on this system, including diverse metrics like foot traffic, vehicle use of beaches, beach grooming and maintenance practices, physical barriers along the beach <span class="citation">(Farmer et al. 2000)</span>; direct human development such as buildings; trash and debris presence <span class="citation">(USACE 2009)</span>; and general levels of land use intensity <span class="citation">(Seavey, Gilmer, and McGarigal 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>For the NYBEM, habitat suitability is modeled based on a relative metric of development for adjacent uplands within 100m. When the percentage of developed adjacent uplands is greater than 10%, habitat suitability in the estuarine intertidal ecosystem declines. When the development of adjacent upland reaches 100% of the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, the habitat will no longer be considered suitable.</p>

<p>Vegetative cover in the intertidal zone produces both positive and negative ecological effects. Animal movement can be disrupted by the presence of vegetation, such as the precipitous declines in habitat suitability for least tern beyond 20-25% herbaceous or shrub canopy cover <span class="citation">(Carreker 1985)</span>. Conversely, vegetation can be a positive attribute and a key transitional feature moving upland toward dune environments, as well as define the difference between the lower intertidal (below MTL) and higher intertidal (above MTL)<span class="citation">(USACE 2009)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>REVISIT THIS SUITABILITY CURVE BASED ON GULF OF MAINE MODELS.</strong></p>
<p>For NYBEM, these competing outcomes are balanced by extending the range of suitable habitat to sparse coverage of 40% with subsequent declines as vegetation becomes dense. This parameter is assessed through the region based on nationally available Landfire data for existing vegetation cover. Suitability indices are computed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[veg.cover = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; cover_{per}=0-40\\

<p>Intertidal areas provide important habitat corridors for organism movement. However, shoreline armoring such as bulkheads or revetments can inhibit movement of the resident taxa (as well as the ecosystem migrating inland with sea level change). Numerous authors have highlighted the negative role that shoreline armoring can play in marine intertidal systems (<span class="citation">USACE (2009)</span>; <span class="citation">Lathrope et al. (2013)</span>). Ideal habitat suitability would occur in the absence of shoreline armoring, but many shorelines are extensively hardened in the developed New York Bight region.</p>
<p>For NYBEM, the distance to the nearest armored shoreline is used as a relative measure of habitat suitability. Habitat is considered more suitable with increasing distance to armoring. NOAA’s <a href="https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/resources/environmental-sensitivity-index-esi-maps">Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI)</a> contains mapped extent of shoreline armoring and is used to assess presence or absence consistently across the region. A suitability index is then assessed as follows:</p>

<p>Light penetration provides an important metric of general water quality as well as suitability for submerged aquatic vegetation. Specifically, light availability drives photosynthesis in SAV. Light attenuates within the water column based on depth and water clarity (i.e., the deeper and more turbid the water, the less light reaches the bottom). For the <code>mar.sub</code>, light availability and suitability are modeled following the same algorithms described for the <code>est.sub</code> model (See Section 4.4), which can be summarized in suitability terms as as:</p>

<p>The marine, deepwater ecosystem considers areas with salinity values greater or equal to 30 psu and depths between 2 – 20 m. Physical, biological and chemical variables may be compounded by anthropogenic and climatic pressures to influence the overall integrity of this system. <strong>Figure XX</strong> presents a conceptual model of the marine, deepwater ecosystem. This ecosystem is strongly dominated by large-scale oceanographic processes and less so by potential coastal storm risk management features. Ecologically, this ecosystem hosts a variety of species of management interest such as mammals, turtles, surf clams, migratory fish, and flounder (winter).</p>

<p>The following variables are used to assess the marine deepwater submodel: a) salinity, b) velocity and currents, c) light attenuation, and d) vessel traffic. Salinity acts as a proxy for vertical mixing of the water column and influence of freshwater inputs <span class="citation">(Smit et al. 2021)</span>. Current velocities represent mixing and flushing of the system, sediment suspension, and benthic scouring. Light penetration depths within the water column indicate water column turbidity, nutrient loading and algal production levels. Finally, vessel traffic provides an index for development pressures, both i) commercial and recreational fishing pressure on the pelagic, demersal and benthic systems, and ii) commercial and recreational vessel density pressures on the marine mammal populations within the area (population stress from ship strikes and noise pollution). The overall habitat suitability of the marine, deepwater zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these four metrics.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.1</span> Salinity<a href="quantification.html#salinity-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Salinity, often used as a proxy for the total concentration of all dissolved salts in the water, is a key factor in water density that controls the vertical mixing of nutrients and chemicals throughout the water column. Salinity constrains dissolved oxygen concentration and limits speciation of marine zones to euryhaline taxa that are physiological adapted to tolerate hypoosmotic processes (are able to maintain a lower internal ionic concentration than seawater).</p>
<p>For NYBEM, the salinity regime is summarized through a metric of the percent of time salinity is less than the marine ecosystem threshold of 30 psu. This approach assumes that freshwater inputs serve as disturbance on the ecosystem, and higher marine levels of salinity are preferred. Depth-averaged salinity is computed or measured at small time steps over and annual timeframe. These data may then be summarized as an “exceedence curve” with thresholds from 0-100% in 10% intervals. For NYBEM, this exceedence curve is used to calculate the percent of time salinity is less than or equal to 30 psu.</p>
<p>This duration metric is then translated into a suitability metric as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[salinity.low.dur = \begin{pmatrix} -0.02*sal_{dur}+1 &amp; sal_{dur}=0-50\\
0.0 &amp; sal_{dur}=50-100

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.2</span> Current Velocity<a href="quantification.html#current-velocity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The marine deepwater environment is subjected to velocity effects from ocean currents and tides that affect vertical and horizontal mixing and flushing of the system, suspended sediment and solids, substrate settlement of taxa, as well as the operation of small and recreational vessels. Low flow conditions allow for the settlement of sediment, possibly burying viable habitat, reducing mixing and flushing, and potentially facilitating hypoxic conditions. Conversely, high velocities scour the benthic environment, prohibiting settling in the substrate by benthic taxa.</p>
<p>Low flow conditions are particularly of concern for these processes, so a representative low velocity (i.e., 10% exceedance probability) is used within NYBEM as a key indicator metric. Suitability is then calculated based on the change in this low velocity relative to a baseline condition. For NYBEM, the baseline condition is assessed as the existing condition for a representative tidal year. Suitability declines linearly beyond a 10% change in this metric from the baseline with sharper decreases as velocities slow.</p>

<p>The depth that light reaches within the water column acts as a proxy for the viability of water column turbidity, nutrient loading, and chlorophyll-a production (an essential building block for ocean productivity). As light controls chlorophyll-a production, it may be seen as a limiting factor for algal and particulate organic matter densities, and ultimately the development of harmful algal blooms. Therefore, light provides a meaningful metric for a variety of biological processes in this ecosystem.

<p>The marine deepwater zone is affected by many processes not included in NYBEM. Future model development could explore the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dissolved oxygen concentration, a key element for the survival of marine species, limits speciation of marine zones through hypoxia, where low oxygen levels may cause die-offs in marine species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations act as a proxy for pelagic, demersal and benthic fauna biomass (abundance/diversity of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, marine turtles, birds and mammals). Data could potentially be integrated from sources such as permanent monitoring stations, as supported by NYC DEP Monitoring Stations (2018), Jamaica Bay Eutrophication Model <span class="citation">(Fischbach et al. 2018)</span>, frameworks such as the Chesapeake Bay model <span class="citation">(Cerco and Cole 1993)</span>, and the EPA Long Island Sound integrated model (underway).<br />
</li>
<li>Water temperature acts as a control for the majority of the chemical (dissolved nutrients, pH, density, and photosynthesis), biological (respiration and metabolic rates, taxa development, and migrations) and physical (ice formation and thermal stratification of the water column) properties of a marine ecosystem. Methods could be adapted from the Winter flounder habitat suitability model <span class="citation">(Banner and Schaller 2001)</span> and VIMS 2018 habitat suitability models and the USACE Harbor monitoring <span class="citation">(USACE 2013)</span>, and data could potentially be extracted from MARACOOS Monthly Sea Surface Temperature via the MARCO Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal or via hydrodynamic model outputs.<br />
</li>
<li>The wave environment affects many variables with the New York Bight: vertical and horizontal mixing and flushing of the physical and chemical properties of the water, suspended sediment and solids, substrate settlement of taxa, and commercial and recreational vessel traffic. Wave height and wave refraction could be assessed from analytical software such as STWAVE (<span class="citation">Byrnes et al. (2004)</span>).<br />
</li>
<li>In the present iteration of NYBEM, light attenuation is assumed to be dependent on a single light coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(K_{d}\)</span>). However, light attentuation can vary significantly based on suspended sediment concentration, algal processes, or water color, all of which may vary in time. Future version of the model could also consider spatially distributed data sets of light coefficients such as those by <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/66148">NOAA</a>.</li>
