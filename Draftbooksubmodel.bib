Conceptual models should be required as a first step in the planning process, as they provide a key link between early planning e.g., an effective statement of problem, need, opportunity, and constraint and later evaluation and implementation. Conceptual models are descriptions of the general functional relationships among essential components of an ecosystem. They tell the story of how the system works and, in the case of ecosystem restoration, how restoration actions aim to alter those processes or attributes for the betterment of the system. As such, conceptual models can provide the Ecosystem Restoration Team with a synthesis of the current understanding of how a system works help in understanding and diagnosing the underlying problem a basis for isolating cause and effect and simplifying complex systems a common framework or mental picture from which to develop alternatives a tool for making qualitative predictions of ecosystem response a way to flag potential thresholds, from which system responses may accelerate or follow potentially unexpected or divergent paths a means by which to outline further restoration, RD, and computational efforts a supplement to numerical models for assessing project benefits and impacts a means of identifying appropriate monitoring indicators and metrics, and a basis for implementing adaptive management strategies Most professionals rely heavily upon conceptual models, but few explicitly formulate and express the models such that they provide broad utility for ecosystem restoration.},

	abstract = {Tides are changing worldwide at rates not explained by astronomical forcing. Rather, the observed evolution of tides and other long waves, such as storm surges, is influenced by shelf processes and changes to the roughness, depth, width, and length of embayments, estuaries, and tidal rivers. In this review, we focus on processes in estuaries and tidal rivers, because that is where the largest changes to tidal properties are occurring. Recent literature shows that changes in tidal amplitude have been ubiquitous worldwide over the past century, often in response to wetland reclamation, channel dredging, and other environmental changes. While tidal amplitude changes are sometimes slight ({\textless}1\%) or even negative, we identify two types of systems that are particularly prone to tidal amplification: ( a) shallow, strongly damped systems, in which a small increase in depth produces a large decrease in effective friction, and ( b) systems in which wave reflection and resonance are strongly influenced by changes to depth, friction, and convergence. The largest changes in amplitude occur inland, some distance from the coast, and can sometimes be measured in meters. Tide changes are a leading indicator that the dynamics of storm surges and river flood waves have also changed and are often associated with shifts in sediment transport, salinity intrusion, and ecosystem properties. Therefore, the dynamics of tidal evolution have major implications for coastal management, particularly for systems that are sensitive to changes in geometry induced by sea-level rise and anthropogenic development.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Climate change is altering naturally fluctuating environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine ecosystems across the globe. Departures from long-term averages and ranges of environmental variables are increasingly being observed as directional changes [e.g., rising sea levels, sea surface temperatures (SST)] and less predictable periodic cycles (e.g., Atlantic or Pacific decadal oscillations) and extremes (e.g., coastal flooding, marine heatwaves). Quantifying the short- and long-term impacts of climate change on tidal marsh seascape structure and function for nekton is a critical step toward fisheries conservation and management. The multiple stressor framework provides a promising approach for advancing integrative, cross-disciplinary research on tidal marshes and food web dynamics. It can be used to quantify climate change effects on and interactions between coastal oceans (e.g., SST, ocean currents, waves) and watersheds (e.g., precipitation, river flows), tidal marsh geomorphology (e.g., vegetation structure, elevation capital, sedimentation), and estuarine and coastal nekton (e.g., species distributions, life history adaptations, predator-prey dynamics). However, disentangling the cumulative impacts of multiple interacting stressors on tidal marshes, whether the effects are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, and the time scales at which they occur, poses a significant research challenge. This perspective highlights the key physical and ecological processes affecting tidal marshes, with an emphasis on the trophic linkages between marsh production and estuarine and coastal nekton, recommended for consideration in future climate change studies. Such studies are urgently needed to understand climate change effects on tidal marshes now and into the future.},

              The nearshore land-water interface is an important ecological zone that faces anthropogenic pressure from development in coastal regions throughout the world. Coastal waters and estuaries like Chesapeake Bay receive and process land discharges loaded with anthropogenic nutrients and other pollutants that cause eutrophication, hypoxia, and other damage to shallow-water ecosystems. In addition, shorelines are increasingly armored with bulkhead (seawall), riprap, and other structures to protect human infrastructure against the threats of sea-level rise, storm surge, and erosion. Armoring can further influence estuarine and nearshore marine ecosystem functions by degrading water quality, spreading invasive species, and destroying ecologically valuable habitat. These detrimental effects on ecosystem function have ramifications for ecologically and economically important flora and fauna. This special issue of
              Estuaries and Coasts
              explores the interacting effects of coastal land use and shoreline armoring on estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. The majority of papers focus on the Chesapeake Bay region, USA, where 50 major tributaries and an extensive watershed ({\textasciitilde} 167,000 km
              2
              ), provide an ideal model to examine the impacts of human activities at scales ranging from the local shoreline to the entire watershed. The papers consider the influence of watershed land use and natural versus armored shorelines on ecosystem properties and processes as well as on key natural resources.},

Models help to organize our thinking, conceptualize our understanding of complex systems, and forecast environmental benefits that may result from proposed restoration and management actions. This report provides information to guide environmental planers in selection, development, evaluation and documentation of ecological models. A number of critical issues are addressed, including specifying objectives and formulating a sound conceptual model, choosing among types of models, deciding when to develop a new model, systematically evaluating the quantitative model, addressing parameter and model uncertainty, developing sections of the model through iteration, analyzing alternatives and documenting results. Quantitative modeling is shown to be a dynamic process that is best served using an iterative approach. In practice, individual parts of a conceptual model are quantified and evaluated in a stepwise fashion until the entire model is captured quantitatively. This iterative approach creates transparency in model development, which can remove the black-box stigma that has been associated with the use of models in the environmental sciences.},

	abstract = {Models contribute vitally to ecosystem conservation and restoration decision-making. Restoration project planning in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers USACE may proceed rapidly from project conception to feasibility-level design through a series of sequential decisions, which iteratively articulate the federal interest, quantify the benefits and costs of competing management actions, and reduce uncertainty in project outcomes. In this process, numerical tools are applied to purposes as diverse as enhancing understanding of complex ecological processes, comparing alternative management actions, and building trust and buy-in among stakeholders. Owing to the relatively short planning horizon typically three years and high complexity of USACE projects typically large-scale or watershed-scale actions, there is a perception that ecological models cannot be developed during project planning. This technical note addresses this misconception through three mechanisms. First, the ecological model development process is presented along with examples of modeling misconceptions observed in other agencies and management contexts. Second, common uses of ecological models are explicitly mapped to the USACE planning processes, timelines, and milestones. Third, an example of ecological model development and review is presented for an ongoing USACE watershed restoration study in Proctor Creek, Atlanta, Georgia. From these three lines of evidence, we conclude that ecological model development is not only possible in USACE studies, it is integral and complementary to the goals of the agencys planning process.},

	abstract = {In this section we introduce a number of approaches and techniques that are commonly used in spatial data analysis
and modelling.
Spatial data are mostly like other data. The same general principles apply. But there are few things that are rather
important to consider when using spatial data that are not common with other data types. These are discussed in
Chapters 2 and 3 and include issues of scale and zonation (the modifiable areal unit problem), distance and spatial
autocorrelation.
The other chapters, introduce methods in different areas of spatial data analysis. These include the three classical area
of spatial statistics (point pattern analysis, regression and inference with spatial data, geostatistics (interpolation using
Kriging), as well some other methods (local and global regression and classification with spatial data).
Some of the material presented here is based on examples in the book “Geographic Information Analysis” by David
O’Sullivan and David J. Unwin. This book provides an excellent and very accessible introduction to spatial data
analysis. It has much more depth than what we present here. But the book does not show how to practically implement
the approaches that are discussed — which is the main purpose of this website.
The spatial statistical methods are treated in much more detail in “Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R” by Bivand,
Pebesma and Gómez-Rubio.
This section builds on our Introduction to Spatial Data Manipulation R, that you should read first.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Despite its widespread use, the ecological effects of shoreline armoring are poorly synthesized and difficult to generalize across soft sediment environments and structure types. We developed a conceptual model that scales predicted ecological effects of shore-parallel armoring based on two axes: engineering purpose of structure (reduce/slow velocities or prevent/stop flow of waves and currents) and hydrodynamic energy (e.g., tides, currents, waves) of soft sediment environments. We predicted greater ecological impacts for structures intended to stop as opposed to slow water flow and with increasing hydrodynamic energy of the environment. We evaluated our predictions with a literature review of effects of shoreline armoring for six possible ecological responses (habitat distribution, species assemblages, trophic structure, nutrient cycling, productivity, and connectivity). The majority of studies were in low-energy environments (51 of 88), and a preponderance addressed changes in two ecological responses associated with armoring: habitat distribution and species assemblages. Across the 207 armoring effects studied, 71\% were significantly negative, 22\% were significantly positive, and 7\% reported no significant difference. Ecological responses varied with engineering purpose of structures, with a higher frequency of negative responses for structures designed to stop water flow within a given hydrodynamic energy level. Comparisons across the hydrodynamic energy axis were less clear-cut, but negative responses prevailed ({\textgreater}78\%) in high-energy environments. These results suggest that generalizations of ecological responses to armoring across a range of environmental contexts are possible and that the proposed conceptual model is useful for generating predictions of the direction and relative ecological impacts of shoreline armoring in soft sediment ecosystems.},

@book{cowardin_classification_1979,
	address = {Washington, D.C.},
	title = {Classification of wetlands and deepwater habitats of the {United} {States}},
	url = {https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/documents/classwet/index.html},
	abstract = {This classification, to be used in a new inventory of wetlands and deepwater habitats of the United States, is intended to describe ecological taxa, arrange them in a system useful to resource managers, furnish units for mapping, and provide uniformity of concepts and terms. Wetlands are defined by plants (hydrophytes), soils (hydric soils), and frequency of flooding. Ecologically related areas of deep water, traditionally not considered wetlands, are included in the classification as deepwater habitats.
Systems form the highest level of the classification hierarchy; five are defined--Marine, Estuarine, Riverine, Lacustrine, and Palustrine. Marine and Estuarine Systems each have two Subsystems, Subtidal and Intertidal; the Riverine System has four Subsystems, Tidal, Lower Perennial, Upper Perennial, and Intermittent; the Lacustrine has two, Littoral and Limnetic; and the Palustrine has no Subsystems.

Within the Subsystems, Classes are based on substrate material and flooding regime, or on vegetative life form. The same Classes may appear under one or more of the Systems or Subsystems. Six Classes are based on substrate and flooding regime: (1) Rock Bottom with a substrate of bedrock, boulders, or stones; (2) Unconsolidated Bottom with a substrate of cobbles, gravel, sand, mud, or organic material; (3) Rocky Shore with the same substrates as Rock Bottom; (4) Unconsolidated Shore with the same substrates as Unconsolidated Bottom; (5) Streambed with any of the substrates; and (6) Reef with a substrate composed of the living and dead remains of invertebrates (corals, mollusks, or worms). The bottom Classes, (1) and (2) above, are flooded all or most of the time and the shore Classes, (3) and (4), are exposed most of the time. The Class Streambed is restricted to channels of intermittent streams and tidal channels that are dewatered at low tide. The life form of the dominant vegetation defines the five Classes based on vegetative form: (1) Aquatic Bed, dominated by plants that grow principally on or below the surface of the water; (2) Moss-Lichen Wetland, dominated by mosses or lichens; (3) Emergent Wetland, dominated by emergent herbaceous angiosperms; (4) Scrub-Shrub Wetland, dominated by shrubs or small trees; and (5) Forested Wetland, dominated by large trees.

The Dominance Type, which is named for the dominant plant or animal forms, is the lowest level of the classification hierarchy. Only examples are provided for this level; Dominance Types must be developed by individual users of the classification.

Modifying terms applied to the Classes or Subclasses are essential for use of the system. In tidal areas, the type and duration of flooding are described by four Water Regime Modifiers: subtidal, irregularly exposed, regularly flooded, and irregularly flooded. In nontidal areas, eight Regimes are used: permanently flooded, intermittently exposed, semipermanently flooded, seasonally flooded, saturated, temporarily flooded, intermittently flooded, and artificially flooded. A hierarchical system of Water Chemistry Modifiers, adapted from the Venice System, is used to describe the salinity of the water. Fresh waters are further divided on the basis of pH. Use of a hierarchical system of soil modifiers taken directly from U.S. soil taxonomy is also required. Special modifiers are used where appropriate: excavated, impounded, diked, partly drained, farmed, and artificial.

Regional differences important to wetland ecology are described through a regionalization that combines a system developed for inland areas by R. G. Bailey in 1976 with our Marine and Estuarine provinces.

The structure of the classification allows it to be used at any of several hierarchical levels. Special data required for detailed application of the system are frequently unavailable, and thus data gathering may be prerequisite to classification. Development of rules by the user will be required for specific map scales. Dominance Types and relationships of plant and animal communities to environmental characteristics must also be developed by users of the classification. Keys to the Systems and Classes are furnished as a guide, and numerous wetlands and deepwater habitats are illustrated and classified. The classification system is also compared with several other systems currently in use in the United States.},

sediment deposition, summer-average organic content, and surface-sediment grain size distributions were
explainable using combinations of independent variables, including elevation, plant distributions, and distances to the tidal inlet and an adjacent stream. Sedimentation and vegetation were both observed to show
a predictable response to disturbance by animal activity.},
