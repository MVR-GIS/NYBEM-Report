## Estuarine, Intertidal Submodel (est.int) (I)

<span style="color: red;">Check equations.</span>

Estuarine environments include marine water that has been diluted by freshwater runoff from the land [@prosser_impacts_2018]. Due to tidal influence, intertidal ecosystems are found between high and low tide, experiencing varying land and sea influences, whereas subtidal ecosystems are constantly submerged. The estuarine intertidal ecosystem considers areas with salinity values greater than 0.5 psu to 30 psu and elevation from MHHW to MLLW. Plant, animal, and microorganism populations, as well as their nonliving surroundings, interact as a working unit in intertidal ecosystems, which are exposed at low tides (Citation). Within the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, ecological processes are linked to physical and chemical characteristics. These characteristics can experience change under anthropogenic and climatic pressures that deviate from the homeostasis, or baseline, habitat condition. This can result in reduced habitat suitability across the estuarine intertidal ecosystem.   

Tidal marshes are vegetated intertidal ecosystems found at the land-sea interface that serve as crucial transition zones for marine, freshwater, and terrestrial processes [@colombano_climate_2021]. Tidal marshes originated in a range of coastal and estuarine environments, and their location exposes them to a number of environmental factors (e.g., ocean currents, watershed hydrology) and environmental gradients (e.g., salinity)[@lauchlan_species_2020]. Broad-scale climatic changes are already affecting the timing, size, and duration of naturally varying environmental variables in estuarine, and freshwater settings. Understanding the changes in environmental stressors from climate change and sea level rise (SLR) on the tidal marsh ecosystem is critical to evaluate changes after the addition of storm surge barriers. 

The following variables are accessible to the estuarine intertidal submodel portion of the NYBEM: salinity, episodic sediment deposition, edge erosion, vegetative cover, development of adjacent uplands, and the presence/absence of shoreline armoring.

![*Conceptual model for the estuarine, intertidal submodel.*](ZZ_Fig05_Est.Int_ConModel.png)

The overall habitat suitability of the marine, intertidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these six metrics.


$I_{est.int} = \frac{salinity + erosion + veg.cover + deposition + upland + shoreline}{6}$ 

Where $I_{est.int}$ is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the marine intertidal zone, $salinity$ is a suitability index relative to salinity, $erosion$ is a suitability index relative to the edge erosion, $veg.cover$ is a suitability index relative to vegetative cover, $deposition$ is a suitability index relative to episodic sediment deposition, $upland$ is a suitability index relative to adjacent upland land uses, and $shoreline$ is a suitability index relative to shoreline armoring. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal.

### Salinity

Salinity has an impact on physical and chemical processes including flocculation and the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, as well as the kinds of organisms that can live in an estuary. Estuarine organisms have evolved to cope with salinity fluctuations. Those that prefer fresher water at the upstream river end of the estuary to species that prefer saltier water at the downstream sea end usually form a gradient. Estuarine plants and animals suffer when extremely high salinities persist for lengthy periods of time. During instances of heavy freshwater inflows from rivers, harm might also occur. Extreme events are the issue in both scenarios.

Higher salinity, lower nutrient intake, and lower sediment inputs, that are associated with extremely low river inflow, can stress or kill plants and animals, limit productivity (owing to nutritional deficiency), and destroy marshes due to low sediment input. Low estuary salinity kills marine creatures when river inflow is extremely high; while excessive nutrient inputs contribute to algae blooms; and increased sediment input suffocates sea grasses and oysters [@hopkinson_lateral_2018]. 

For NYBEM, the salinity regime is represented by a percentage of time where salinity is less than 30 psu, the estuarine intertidal ecological threshold. Freshwater inputs are assumed to be a disruption to the environment, and moderate salinity levels are recommended (less than 30 psu). Over an annual timescale, depth-averaged salinity is estimated or measured at short time steps. The data can then be summarized as a "exceedence curve," with thresholds ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments. The percent of time that salinity is less than or equal to 30 psu is calculated using this exceedence curve in NYBEM.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Examples of exceedence duration calculation
exceedence <- seq(0,100,10)

salinity.ex1 <- c(22, 23, 24, 29.5, 29.9, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37)
approx(salinity.ex1, exceedence, xout = 30, method = "linear", rule = 2, ties = "ordered")$y

salinity.ex2 <- c(24, 26, 27, 28, 30.1, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42)
approx(salinity.ex2, exceedence, xout = 30, method = "linear", rule = 2, ties = "ordered")$y

salinity.ex3 <- c(24, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40)
approx(salinity.ex3, exceedence, xout = 30, method = "linear", rule = 2, ties = "ordered")$y

salinity.ex4 <- c(30.5, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40)
approx(salinity.ex4, exceedence, xout = 30, method = "linear", rule = 2, ties = "ordered")$y
```

This duration metric is then translated into a suitability metric as follows:

$$salinity.mod.dur = \begin{pmatrix} -0.02*sal_{dur}+1 & sal_{dur}=0-50\\
0.0 & sal_{dur}=50-100
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $salinity.mod.dur$ is a suitability index relative to moderate salinity periods and $sal_{dur}$ is the percent of time salinity is less than the threshold for marine habitat (i.e., salinity < 30 psu).


### Edge Erosion

Climate change, pollution, and other anthropogenic effects are putting more pressure on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Coastal flooding and shoreline erosion will likely become more common as sea levels rise and storm surges shift as a result of climate change. There is fear that tidal wetlands will drown as sea levels rise and sediment supplies to the shore decline across the world. Marsh sediment budgets are a geographically integrated measure of opposing constructive and destructive forces: a surplus of sediment can lead to vertical growth and/or lateral expansion, while a shortfall can lead to drowning and/or lateral contraction [@ganju_spatially_2017]. Many estuarine marshes face sediment deficits along the shoreline as a result of increased edge erosion. Edge degradation causes morphological changes that make it easier for waves to propagate to the marsh borders and promote the resuspension and export of sediments from the estuary [@li_wave-driven_2019].

 The percent change in edge erosion throughout the estuarine intertidal ecosystem is used to represent habitat suitability. When the percentage of shear stress for erosion is 10% or greater, erosion occurs, resulting in a reduction in total marsh area and an increase in open water area. At a rate of 30% shear stress from erosion, the habitat will no longer be suitable (habitat suitability equals zero.


$$erosion = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & vel_{delta}=-50-10\\
-0.025*urban_{per}+1.25 & vel_{delta}=10-50
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $erosion$ is a suitability index relative to edge erosion and $vel_{delta}$ is the percent change in velocity relative to the existing condition.


### Vegetation Cover

Vegetation provides various ecological services within the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, including providing a fish nursery environment, feed for migratory birds, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and sediment stability. Therefore reductions of vegetative cover can have a significant impact on shallow marine ecosystems. Seagrass meadows are disappearing at an alarming rate in shallow coastal and estuary marine environments, with losses similar to tropical rainforests, mangroves, and coral reefs due to anthropogenic and climate stress [@walter_large-scale_2020]. 

The loss of vegetative cover changes the dynamics near the seabed in locations where there was formerly vegetation. This loss transforms huge areas of the estuary from a deposition and accretion-friendly environment to one that favors suspension and erosion. For estuaries, high amounts of suspended particles and sediment-associated nutrients create a variety of environmental management issues [@cotton_effects_2006]. 

For the NYBEM, habitat suitability increases as the percentage of vegetative cover increases throughout the habitat. When vegetative cover is equal to 100 percent, the estuarine intertidal ecosystem will have a high suitability value (greater than 90%).

$$veg.cover = 0.9*cover_{per}+0.1$$ 

Where $veg.cover$ is a suitability index relative to vegetation cover and $cover_{per}$ is the percent of vegetation coverage.


### Episodic Sediment Deposition

Estuaries are efficient sediment traps. Near-bottom circulation causes sediment flow convergence during the transition from brackish to fresh water, resulting in local maxima in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and deposition rates. Marine materials are deposited from the continental shelf into estuarine habitats. Due to disparities in tidal currents (ebb versus flood tide), sediments are carried to supply sediment on varying time frames. In the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, sediment transport capacity is mostly determined by river discharge, by the timing of discharge events in relation to the spring–neap cycle, and subtidal oscillations in sea level [@prosser_impacts_2018]. 

Due to the retreat of the salinity intrusion and increasing bed pressures, sediment deposition episodes can induce considerable bed resuspension in the estuary. Periodic flood and storm events are major drivers in sediment dynamics and contribute disproportionately to the total sediment discharge [@ralston_sediment_2013]. During these episodes of retreating salinity intrusions and increasing bed pressures, sediment deposition episodes can induce considerable bed resuspension in the estuary. The duration of high-discharge episodes in relation to the estuarine reaction time, a feature that fluctuates seasonally with discharge and estuarine length, also affects sediment transport capacity  [@palinkas_sediment_2014]. These short-term events can cause changes in the local biological community and affect seabed stability and strength. As a relative output of sediment, we adopt the ratio of water depth ranges to the tidal range, which we calculate as follows:

$$d_{rel} = \frac{H_{max} - H_{min}}{Hmedian}$$

Where $d_{rel}$ is water depth relative to the minimum and maximum water height measurements, $H_{max}$ is the maximum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, $H_{min}$ is the minimum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, and $H_{median}$ is the median depth observed over a hydrodynamic stimulation period.

These then affect sediment mixing and activation, as well as tides, which affect water infiltration and exfiltration through the sediment [@nancy_jackson_armoring_2010]. During storms, erosion of the shoreline can result in the removal of material from the upper foreshore and deposition on the lower foreshore, or the foreshore moving horizontally landward. In coastal and estuary environments across the world, harmful algal blooms (HABs) have substantial economic, public health, and ecological consequences. The influx of additional nutrients following an episode of sediment deposition have been known to cause harmful algal blooms (HABs)[@ralston_temperature_2014]. Further, the frequent upturn of sediment can displace biological organisms. For example, horseshoe crabs are significantly affected by the above mentioned foreshore processes caused by episodic storms. 

The relationship between sediment deposition and water level rise can be used to quantify habitat suitability within the esturarine intertidal ecosystem. When water level increases, sediment deposition will be at an optimal level to support esturarine intertidal habitat. This metric provides a relative accounting for the variances in depth across the ecosystem. For instance, $d_{rel}>1$ occurs in portions of the esturarine intertidal ecosystem that experience optimal sediment deposition conditions less than 90% exceedance from $H_{median}$, and in portions of the esturarine intertidal ecosystem that experience optimal sediment deposition conditions less than 10% exceedance from $H_{median}$. In terms of habitat suitability, we assume that ideal values of this metric occur around 0.5 (near 1.1 meter depth) and suitability declines on either side of this threshold as follows: 

_Please check equation_

$$deposition = \begin{pmatrix} 0.02*d_{rel} & d_{rel}<0.5\\
-0.02*d_{rel}+2 & d_{rel}>0.5\\
0.0 & d_{rel}>1.0
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $deposition$ is a suitability index relative to episodic sediment deposition and $depth_{m}$ is the change in depth in meters.


### Developement of Adjacent Upland

The development of uplands within a watershed can have a direct and indirect impact on a variety of essential aspects in estuarine intertidal ecosystems. The combination of coastal erosion and upland development causes a “coastal squeeze,” in which low-lying, intertidal regions, that would usually recede inland in the face of sea-level rise, are diminished because man-made structures (e.g. shoreline armoring) prevent such retreat [@prosser_impacts_2018]. This means that tidal marshes will need to shift upslope onto nearby uplands to survive during a period of rapid sea-level rise. Land management methods on the tidal marsh's upland border can help or hinder ecosystem migration in response to increasing sea levels [@anisfeld_upslope_2017].

Both developed and undeveloped uplands can experience ecological stress as a result of climate change and land use changes (e.g. addition of storm surge barriers, shoreline armoring). Climate change's effects on ocean and watershed systems are intertwined and set to interact.This is especially true in tidal marshes, which are biogenic environments that are sculpted by tidal and fluvial processes, and are dynamic and architecturally complex [@colombano_climate_2021]. Multiple stressors can affect the development of adjacent uplands such as low-flows, flooding, and reduced stream continuity [@talke_changing_2020]. 

For the NYBEM, habitat suitability is modeled for an increase in development for adjacent uplands. When the percentage of developed adjacent uplands is greater than 10%, habitat suitability in the estuarine intertidal ecosystem declines. When the development of adjacent upland reaches 100% of the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, the habitat will no longer be considered suitable. 

$$land.use = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & urban_{per}=0-50\\
-0.02*urban_{per}+2 & urban_{per}=50-100
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $land.use$ is a suitability index relative to adjacent upland land uses and $urban_{per}$ is the percent of adjancent upland in developed (i.e., urban) land uses within 500m.

### Shoreline Armoring 

Natural biological processes and human-induced changes to the estuarine intertidal shoreline boundary are considered as components to a complex ecological system. The mean high-tide line is commonly used to determine shoreline boundaries and extent [@kittinger_shoreline_2010]. Shoreline modification called armoring has resulted in a considerable loss of coastal ecosystems from erosion, as well as a reduction in the resilience of these systems to disturbance [@kittinger_shoreline_2010]. Shoreline armoring involves placing hardened structures like bulkheads and revetments along the shoreline and as sea levels rise, these structures can prevent coastal marshes from spreading upland over time [@gardner_is_2021]. 

Armoring is widespread throughout the United States, with extensive armoring found near urban areas [@morley_ecological_2012]. Shoreline armoring occupies 50-70% of shorelines along urban coastal areas [@dugan_generalizing_2018]. Increasing shoreline development pressure and predicted sea-level rise suggest that the demand for shoreline armoring will continue to rise and expand throughout the future [@gardner_is_2021]. Shoreline armoring is correlated with decreased habitat complexity, and a reduction in connectivity to adjacent habitats [@morley_ecological_2012].

The environmental consequences of armoring are context dependent, relying on characteristics of the environment and armoring structural factors [@dugan_generalizing_2018]. The type of structure placed (e.g., seawalls, bulkheads, revetments) and its relative placement on the coast profile will influence the biological reactions to armoring. Estuarine intertidal habitats that lack shoreline armoring have increased habitat suitability. For the NYBEM, the presence and absence of shoreline armoring will be utilized to derive information about the ability for multiple taxa to use the shoreline as migratory pathways. 


$$shoreline = \begin{pmatrix} 0.05*dist_{armor}+0.5 & dist_{armor}=0-100m\\
1.0 & dist_{armor}>100m
\end{pmatrix}$$ 

Where $shoreline$ is a suitability index relative to shoreline armoring and $dist_{armor}$ is the distance to the nearest armored shoreline in meters.
