<span style="color: red;">Hall and McKay to write.</span>


1-2 paragraphs providing background on the ecosystem type. Physical properties. Typical ecological functions and ecosystem services.

Present and describe the conceptual model for this system.

**FIGURE**


Describe the main ideas being captured in the model. Summarize as table. Present suitability index curves, which are described in subsequent sections.

**TABLE**

**FIGURE WITH SUITABILITY CURVES**

Present the overarching habitat suitability index equation.

**EQUATION**


### Variable-1

2-5 paragraphs presenting three main ideas.

Provide some general context for this variable's role in ecosystem function and condition.  

Describe how this variable is assessed and quantified in NYBEM.

Present the equation for assessing the suitability index.

### Variable-2

2-5 paragraphs presenting three main ideas.

Provide some general context for this variable's role in ecosystem function and condition.  

Describe how this variable is assessed and quantified in NYBEM.

Present the equation for assessing the suitability index.

### mar.deep Code

Numerical code for assessing habitat quality (<span style="color: red;">Dougherty and McKay to write.</span>)


```{r echo=TRUE}
#Function for assessing habitat quality
mar.deep <- function(x, y){
  mar.deep.HSI <- x + y

  #Send output
  mar.deep.HSI
}
```
