In these study areas, the USACE is considering a diversity of measures for mitigating flood risks, including structural actions (e.g., levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers), non-structural measures (e.g., buy-outs, elevation of structures, flood-proofing), and natural and nature-based features (e.g., wetland creation, reefs for breakwaters). Environmental outcomes and acceptability are important constraints on plan selection, and the studies are applying a tiered approach to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM) is being developed as a tool for partially assessing the direct and indirect effects of agency actions on regional ecosystems. The NYBEM assesses changes in habitat quantity and quality associated with changing hydrodynamic conditions in six major ecosystem types: freshwater tidal, estuarine intertidal, estuarine subtidal, marine intertidal, marine subtidal, and marine deepwater. The numerical code for NYBEM was programmed in the R Statistical Software Language, and the model code is contained within an R-package (nybem), which is available via github. This report documents the development of this tool, including information on model scoping, the development process, conceptualization, quantification, and evaluation, and code is also available via github. The NYBEM is then applied to assess the existing condition of ecosystems in the New Jersey Back Bay study area. Acknowledgements Model development was funded by two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility studies in the New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB) and NY/NJ Harbor and Tributaries Study (HATS). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also partially funded research aspects of this work through the Ecosystem Management and Restoration Research Program. The authors are grateful to the USACE project team members and workshop attendees for their generous contributions of time, energy, and ideas. In particular, Bryce Wisemiller and JB Smith managed the larger USACE studies; Rob Hampson, Tate McAlpin, Jennifer McAlpin, and Anthony Emiren coordinated and conducted all hydrodynamic modeling; Cheryl Alkemeyer, Carissa Scarpa, and Peter Weppler led environmental impact assessment for the HATS; Jesse Miller provided input and contributions throughout model development; and Elvin Cordero provided important contributions to early formulations of the numerical toolkit.

Glossary and Acronymns ADCIRC: a system of computer programs for solving time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions. These programs utilize the finite element method in space allowing the use of highly flexible, unstructured grids. For this study, ADCIRC was used to predict storm surge. AdH: Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) numerical code is a modular, parallel, adaptive finite-element model for one-, two- and three-dimensional (2D, and 3D) flow and transport. For this study, AdH was used to predict changes in local hydrodynamics. ADM: USACE Agency Decision Milestone. AMM: USACE Alternatives Milestone.
