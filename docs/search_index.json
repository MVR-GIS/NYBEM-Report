In these study areas, the USACE is considering a diversity of measures for mitigating flood risks, including structural actions (e.g., levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers), non-structural measures (e.g., buy-outs, elevation of structures, flood-proofing), and natural and nature-based features (e.g., wetland creation, reefs for breakwaters). Environmental outcomes and acceptability are important constraints on plan selection, and the studies are applying a tiered approach to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM) is being developed as a tool for partially assessing the direct and indirect effects of agency actions on regional ecosystems. The NYBEM assesses changes in habitat quantity and quality associated with changing hydrodynamic conditions in six major ecosystem types: freshwater tidal, estuarine intertidal, estuarine subtidal, marine intertidal, marine subtidal, and marine deepwater. The numerical code for NYBEM was programmed in the R Statistical Software Language, and the model code is contained within an R-package (nybem), which is available via github. This report documents the development of this tool, including information on model scoping, the development process, conceptualization, quantification, and evaluation, and code is also available via github. The NYBEM is then applied to assess the existing condition of ecosystems in the New Jersey Back Bay study area. Acknowledgements Model development was funded by two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility studies in the New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB) and NY/NJ Harbor and Tributaries Study (HATS). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also partially funded research aspects of this work through the Ecosystem Management and Restoration Research Program.

"],["background.html", "Chapter 1 Background 1.1 Problem Statement 1.2 Report Overview", " Chapter 1 Background In response to Superstorm Sandy and associated Congressional directives (PL 113-2), the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) identified nine focus areas with populations vulnerable to coastal flooding risk. Three of these areas are in the New York Bight ecosystem, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is conducting large-scale coastal storm risk management (CSRM) feasibility studies. The New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB) study is investigating 900 mi2 of land and water areas along with 3,400 mi of shoreline spanning a significant portion of New Jerseys Atlantic coastline. The New York-New Jersey Harbor &amp; Tributaries Study (HATS) is examining 2,100 mi2 and comprises parts of 25 counties in the two states. The Nassau County Back Bays (NCBB) study is investigating flood risk in 400 mi2 of land and water areas on Long Islands southern shore. Objectives of these studies include issues such as: (a) reduction of coastal storm damage risks to communities, public infrastructure, important societal resources, and the environment, (b) improvement of a communitys ability to recover from storm surge damages, (c) enhancement of human health and safety by improving performance of critical infrastructure and natural features during and after storm surge events, and (d) enhancement of coastal resilience with nature-based features. Figure 1.1: USACE regional coastal storm risk management studies. NJBB and HATS are the primary focus of model development. In these study areas, the USACE is considering a diversity of measures for mitigating flood risks, including structural actions (e.g., levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers), non-structural measures (e.g., buy-outs, elevation of structures, flood-proofing), and natural and nature-based features (NNBF, e.g., wetland creation, reefs for breakwaters). Environmental outcomes and acceptability are important constraints on plan selection, and recommended plans must be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Given the large spatial scope, these USACE studies are applying a tiered approach to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Tiered assessment intends to provide appropriate data at key planning milestones for complex studies with diverse environmental effects. In the context of these studies, a Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be generated at the conclusion of the USACE Planning Process (i.e., in the Feasibility Report and Chiefs Report). The Tier 1 EIS is being developed with sequentially more accurate and precise information as the planning process proceeds through key milestones such as the Alternatives Milestone Meeting (AMM), Tentatively Selected Plan Milestone (TSP), and Agency Decision Milestone (ADM). A Tier 2 EIS will be developed in Pre-Construction Engineering and Design (PED). 1.1 Problem Statement The conceptual and numerical models presented here seek to articulate and quantify mechanisms of environmental impact of proposed coastal storm risk management alternatives. The following goals guided model development: Models should provide a general description of the relative environmental effects of large-scale alternatives, which can inform the feasibility process and NEPA assessments. Models must be able to forecast environmental effects over the project planning horizon (50-100 years) based on physical changes to ecosystems resulting from both background processes (e.g., sea level rise) and project alternatives (e.g., change in tidal regime from storm surge barriers). Models should assess environmental effects by ecosystem type (e.g., marine deepwater vs.Â estuarine intertidal) to inform mitigation actions. Models should capture direct effects of actions at infrastructure locations (e.g., the footprint of a surge barrier) as well as indirect effects induced off-site from infrastructure (e.g., change in bay hydrodynamics associated with a storm surge barrier). Models should be adaptable to new information and data as project planning proceeds. Models should provide a consistent approach for environmental assessment, which can assist with communication of the cumulative effects of recommended alternatives across the region. 1.2 Report Overview This report presents development and application of the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM, nigh-bem), which will ultimately consist of two separate but interlinked models. First, an index-based modeling framework (i.e., a habitat-suitability-style, quantity-quality approach) is developed here to assess patch-scale effects for six ecosystem types (e.g., estuarine intertidal zones). Second, a network-based model will be developed in the future to assess system-wide connectivity for migratory, aquatic organisms (e.g., anadramous fish). This report documents the technical details, use, and relevant information for USACE model certification (EC 1105-2-412, PB 2013-02) for the patch-scale, habitat-suitability model. The following sections summarize the major elements of model development: Model Development Process: Summarizes the general scope of the model and approach for development. Conceptualization: Describes the overarching view of the structure and function of ecosystems in the New York Bight. Quantification: Reviews the technical details and numerical code of the six ecosystem-specific, patch-scale models. Evaluation: Assesses the model relative to underlying numerical accuracy, scientific theory, and usability. Application and Communication: Describes an application of the NYBEM to assess the existing condition in the New Jersey Back Bays. "],["model-development-process.html", "Chapter 2 Model Development Process 2.1 Spatial Extent 2.2 Phased Approach 2.3 Mediated Modeling", " Chapter 2 Model Development Process When used in the context of complex management decisions with many partners, environmental and ecological modeling often benefit from approaches that emphasize transparency, increase user input during development, and clearly communicate model assumptions and limitations (Van den Belt 2004; Voinov and Bousquet 2010; Herman et al. 2019). Here, a general five-step modeling process is followed that applies best practices in ecological model development (Grant and Swannack 2008). First, general relationships among essential ecosystem components are formally conceptualized to tell the story of how the system works (Fischenich 2008). Second, the model is quantified using a formal structure of functional relationships, algorithms, parameters, and numerical code. Third, models are evaluated relative to underlying scientific theory, numerical accuracy, and usability, which often entails techniques such as code checking, testing, verification, and sensitivity analyses. Fourth, a model is applied to a given management question, scenario, or assessment. Fifth, a strategy is developed and executed to communicate model development and application to technical and non-technical audiences. This process has been applied numerous times to select, adapt, or develop ecological models for USACE and non-USACE studies (e.g., McKay, Richards, and Swannack 2019; Herman et al. 2019), and the framework is intended to draw heavily from existing knowledge, data, and tools. USACE policy (USACE 2011) defines a model as a representation of a system for a purpose, and thus specifying a modeling purpose and objective is often a foundational step in the modeling process. Here, our modeling objective is to articulate the mechanisms and magnitude of environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions in the New York Bight Ecosystem. However, this model (like all models) is being developed in a constrained environment with limited time and resources. Three key issues constrained and guided NYBEM development, each of which is addressed in subsequent sections: The model domain is limited to the spatial extent of the focal USACE studies. Model development is phased to align with USACE project planning milestones. Transparency in model development and input from stakeholders and partners were actively embraced to increase the adoption and acceptance of the tools, given the high-profile nature of the studies. 2.1 Spatial Extent The cumulative project area of the ongoing CSRM studies exceeds 3,000 mi2 and covers multiple states. The spatial extent of model application was defined by a sequence of three sequentially smaller filters (Figure 2): New York Bight: The USFWS defined the ecosystems of the New York Bight in 1997 as the open ocean region south of Long Island and east of New Jersey, known as the New York Bight proper and all associated upstream estuaries, waters, and lands. This large spatial domain covers 31,276 mi2 (10,206 mi2 upland watershed and 21,070 mi2 estuarine or marine). Specifically, the watershed is defined by ten 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watersheds (02020006, 02020007, 02020008, 02030101, 02030103, 02030104, 02030105, 02030202, 02040301, and 02040302). The USFWS Bight definition includes all marine ecosystems offshore. However, given the nearshore scope of USACEs studies, seaward extent is limited to ecosystems above a 20m depth contour (i.e., the USFWS definition of nearshore). This watershed boundary and seaward limit have a total area of 13,420 mi2((USFWS) 1997). However, given the nearshore scope of USACEs studies, seaward extent is limited to ecosystems above a 20m depth contour (i.e., the USFWS definition of nearshore)((USFWS) 1997). Project Boundaries: The Bight ecosystem includes many upland and coastal ecosystems beyond the project boundaries (e.g., Eastern Long Island). The USACE study boundaries provide a second filter on the spatial limits of the NYBEM. The New York Bight ecosystem contained within the project boundaries has an area of 2,930 mi2. Aquatic Ecosystems: A key focus of the NYBEM is assessment of indirect effects of proposed actions. Currently, upland and shoreline ecosystems above mean higher high water (MHHW) are not included in the models. Impact assessments from these systems (e.g., dunes, scrub-shrub, riparian zones) are better understood from prior impact analyses. Additionally, these systems are likely to experience fewer indirect impacts, and methods are generally available for assessing direct impacts. Upland ecosystems are not explicitly removed from the spatial domain at this phase, but are removed below through the absence of any patch-scale models at elevations above MHHW and the absence of hydrodynamic data in uplands. Figure 2.1: NYBEM model domain: (left) Components of model domain, (right) NYBEM domain. 2.2 Phased Approach USACE planning studies sequentially make decisions about potential actions and buy-down risk and uncertainty to inform the next level of decision, before narrowing in on a recommended alternative. Furthermore, the USACE studies have proposed a tiered NEPA assessment, which is designed to gather more data and refine outcomes as a project proceeds. The NYBEM toolkit must be capable of responding to evolving project planning needs and data availability as these studies develop. As such, model development is explicitly being conducted in phases, and NYBEM tools and methods will evolve alongside project planning. In each phase, development will proceed iteratively through the cycle described above of conceptualization, quantification, evaluation, application, and communication. Table 2.1 presents key aspects of this phased approach to development. Table 2.1: Phased approach to development of the NYBEM.

Mediated modeling is used here to describe the family of techniques for building consensus among multiple partners to produce credible and defensible ecological models in a transparent way (Belt et al. 2006). There are many types of stakeholder-based model development processes that overlap in approach and emphasize collaboration: Model Prototyping, Participatory Modeling, Group Model Building, Companion Modeling and Mediated Model Development (See reviews by Voinov and Bousquet 2010; Gray et al. 2017; and Hall, Lazarus, and Thompson 2019). These processes are generally well-suited to environmental management problems that are politically and publicly-sensitive, complex, and engage diverse audiences (Belt et al. 2006). For NYBEM, a suite of workshop-based model development methods are adapted from Herman et al. (2019). These workshops utilize a lecture-exercise format, where participants are led through the theory of a particular aspect of modeling (e.g., conceptual modeling) and then apply said theory to a focal ecosystem (i.e., the New York Bight). The workshops structure the iterative development of NYBEM with subsequent research and synthesis between meetings (See McKay et al.Â 2021 for additional detail). Appendix B summarizes workshop logistics and focal topics. Key milestones in model development are briefly described below, but the overarching strategy is to engage larger audiences and more formal forms of model evaluation as the toolkit develops. Preliminary workshop with Philadelphia District (January 2019): A preliminary conceptual model was developed with USACE Philadelphia District team members, which focused generally on issues potentially relevant for environment compliance at the broadest level. USACE workshop with Philadelphia and New York Districts (March 2019): A joint team from multiple USACE Districts was convened, and a strategy was proposed to develop NYBEM around key ecosystem types to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the modeling problem and structure the path forward for model development. Interagency conceptual modeling workshop (June 2019): Fifty scientists and environmental managers (from federal, state, and local government as well as select non-profit organizations and academic units) were brought together to focus on the development of conceptual models supporting the NYBEM. This workshop utilized a series of posters and activities for attendees to provide input on relevant variables and processes for each ecosystem type. Interagency numerical modeling workshop (November 2019): A subset of attendees (20+) from the June 2019 workshop reconvened to discuss findings from the prior workshops. Prior to this meeting, the posters from June were formalized and synthesized with available scientific literature. At this meeting, attendees were able to review and revise preliminary versions of the model structure. Phase-1 model documentation (April 2022; this report): This report provides model development status as applied to the Draft Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement for each study. USACE requires assessment and external evaluation of ecological models used in Feasibility-level planning decisions (i.e., model certification), and this report will be peer-reviewed according to these agency procedures. Phase-2 development (Fall 2022 / Winter 2023): Habitat quality and system connectivity tools will be further developed following the release of the Draft Feasibility Reports. Any modifications of models will also undergo review and certification. Rapid timelines and iterative development encourage a transparent approach for model documentation as well. We adopt a growing family of methods for reproducible research, which embrace code and data sharing, enable review processes, and facilitate use of methods and results. Specifically, R Markdown is applied to development and document models, which are coded in the R Statistical Software. These tools minimize data transfer errors and facilitate internal inspection of code as it is developed. Similarly, all model code is contained within a transportable R-package (i.e., nybem) following common development procedures. "],["conceptualization.html", "Chapter 3 Conceptualization 3.1 Conceptual Model 3.2 Major Ecosystem Types 3.3 Habitat-Style Modeling Philosophy", " Chapter 3 Conceptualization The foundation of ecological modeling is a clear conceptualization of the ecosystem and an approach for translating the conceptual model into a numerical representation. This chapter describes an overarching conceptual model for the ecosystems of the New York Bight. A strategy is then presented for assessing these ecosystems relative to a habitat-style modeling approach, where the quantity and quality of each ecosystem type are computed separately and combined into an index of ecosystem integrity (i.e., a habitat unit). 3.1 Conceptual Model Conceptual ecological models are required for all USACE ecosystem restoration projects to increase understanding, identify potential alternatives, and facilitate team dialog (Fischenich 2008; USACE 2011). These same benefits apply for assessing environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions. Additionally, conceptual models also inform and structure the development of quantitative ecological models (Grant and Swannack 2008; Swannack, Fischbach, and Tazik 2012) such as the NYBEM. Conceptual models of the New York Bight were iteratively developed through the mediated workshops described in Section 2.3. Workshop ideas and content were synthesized with available literature, conceptual models of similar ecosystems (e.g., wetland function in Coastal Louisiana; Twilley and Barras (n.d.)), and existing regional conceptual models (e.g., Montagna, Palmer, and Beseres Pollack 2013). A seven step conceptual model development process was interactively applied as workshops proceeded (Table 3.1). Table 3.1: Stepwise development of the overarching NYBEM conceptual model (following steps in Fischenich 2008). Step NYBEM Application State the model objectives. Our numerical modeling objective is to articulate the mechanisms and magnitude of environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions in the New York Bight Ecosystem. This conceptual model is intended to communicate the overarching scope of model development to a broad audience. Bound the system of interest. NYBEM is limited to the New York Bight Watershed with a seaward limit of a 20m depth contour. The models are further limited to aquatic ecosystems within the NJBB and HATS project areas. The NYBEM focuses only on effects to regional ecosystem, and other forms of environmental impacts (e.g., air quality, historic preservation) are addressed elsewhere in NEPA documentation. Identify critical model components within the system. This overarching conceptual model focuses on key ecosystem types and system-wide connectivity. Patch-scale models are defined from a combined classification based on Cowardin et al. (1979), USFWS (1997), and Montagna, Palmer, and Beseres Pollack (2013). A series of workshops and literature search were then used to identify ecosystem-specific model components associated with habitat quality (Chapter 4). Articulate relationships among model components. Only ecosystem types are presented, given the communication-driven purpose of this overarching model. More mechanistic conceptual models are presented for each ecosystem type in Chapter 4, which show connections between drivers and stressors, ecosystem states, and ecological outcomes. Represent the conceptual model. A simple graphic representation of the conceptual model (Figure 3.1) was developed to facilitate communication between project team members, sponsors, partner agencies, and other interested parties. Describe the expected pattern of behavior. The team qualitatively assessed the model along with potential gaps in ecosystem types and environmental impacts. Test, review, and revise. This overarching conceptual model was developed, presented, and refined based on a series of modeling workshops over a three year timeframe. Ultimately, multiple conceptual models were developed for the New York Bight with different purposes. We first developed an overarching conceptual model communicating how a mosaic of regional ecosystems function together at a system-scale, which is intended for broad use within both technical and non-technical audiences (Figure 3.1). Three overarching systems were identified to frame model development: (1) nearshore / marine ecosystems, (2) estuarine ecosystems, and (3) system connectivity between multiple ecosystem types. These systems were distinguished based on differences in ecosystem processes such as wave energy and salinity dynamics, likely effects of proposed management alternatives, and potential differences in modeling philosophy (e.g., habitat models for nearshore and estuarine systems and a network approach to connectivity). Cumulatively, these three categories provide a means of assessing nearshore and estuarine ecosystems at a patch-scale as well as a means of assessing system-scale outcomes associated with connectivity. Notably, freshwater non-tidal ecosystems were not included in this analysis, although sea level rise could ultimately affect these systems. The ecosystem types were derived from existing classifications as described below. In addition to this overarching model, mechanistic conceptual models were developed for each ecosystem type to guide quantitative model development (see Chapter 4), which are intended for technical audiences focused on the scientific details of ecological assessments. Figure 3.1: Overarching conceptual model for the New York Bight. 3.2 Major Ecosystem Types Patch-scale assessments were developed for both the marine and estuarine ecosystems. Models were developed for each of six major ecosystem types (Table 3.2). These ecosystems are defined from a combined classification based on multiple sources, namely: Cowardin et al. (1979) and Geographic Data Committee (2013): This seminal work and the associated update differentiate wetland types and deepwater habitats. The reports define deepwater limits as all permanently flooded areas for marine and estuarine systems and 2.5m below low water for freshwater systems. The marine-estuarine boundary is classified based on multiple factors, including salinity greater than 30 ppt with little or no dilution except outside the mouths of estuaries and geographic factors such as an imaginary line closing the mouth of a river, bay, or sound. The estuarine-freshwater boundary extends upstream and landward to where ocean-derived salts measure less than 0.5 ppt during the period of average annual low flow. Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) (Geographic Data Committee\" (2012)): Classifies ecosystems based on aquatic and biogeographic settings. The aquatic setting is defined relative to salinity, depth, and tidal zones. The estuarine-marine boundary is define at the mouth of the estuary as an imaginary line connecting the seaward-most points of land that enclose the estuarine water mass at MLLW. The freshwater-estuarine boundary is defined as the tidally influenced part of the estuary [that] may occur in a fresh reach where salinity is &lt;0.5 [PSUs]. Depth and tidal limits are defined relative to intertidal and subtidal limits as well as open waters up to 4m depth. The biogeographic setting is defined by regional setting, and a series of increasingly detailed filters related to water column, geoform, substrate, and biotic components. The New York Bights biogeography can generally be described from its location in the temperate Northern Atlantic region, but detailed data were unavailable to map and forecast system types based on the more detailed filters. (USFWS) (1997): The USFWS definitions for the New York Bight provide a more regionally specific view of habitat types. The nearshore ecosystem is defined by a 20m depth contour for the ocean, and extend landward to watershed divides. The estuarine-marine and freshwater-estuarine boundaries are defined as 30 ppt and 0.5 ppt, respectively. NY/NJ Port Habitat Functional Assessment Model (USACE (2021)): This suite of models was developed to assess environmental impacts associated with the NY/NJ Harbor Deepening Program. The models define two habitat types. First, a permanently submerged shallow subtidal zone, which comprises the depth range from 0 to 6 feet below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). Second, an intertidal zone comprising the depth range between MLLW and Mean Higher High Water (MHHW). Salinity and tidal range were used to differentiate six ecosystems, both of which can change under futures with and without management actions. While other analyses have developed ecosystem-scale assessments and models based on similar or more refined divisions in physical properties (e.g., CMECS, Clough, Polaczyk, and Propato (2016)), the current criteria represent a compromise between the need for detailed assessment of the type and location of infrastructure impacts, and the need for a readily implementable rule set applicable at the broad spatial scale of the NYBEM. The tidal/depth and salinity thresholds were chosen based on a combination of the systems described above. For instance, a 2m depth contour represented a compromise between 2.5 m recommended by Cowardin et al. (1979) and 6 feet (1.83m) used in USACE (2020). Similarly, salinity zones were classified based on a 10th percentile salinity (i.e., 90% exceedence) to represent the period of average annual low flow identified by Cowardin et al. (1979). However, the threshold of 30 PSU was adjusted to 28 PSU to align with an imaginary line connecting the seaward-most points of land that enclose the estuarine water mass at MLLW (CMECS). Figure 3.2 shows a representative outcome of these thresholds for Great Egg Inlet, New Jersey, which is described in more detail in Chapter 6.3. Table 3.2: Definition of NYBEM ecosystem types. Cowardin et al.Â (1979) define the marine-estuarine salinity transition based on a period of average annual low flow, which we define here as a 90% exceedence probability (or 10th percentile salinity). Tidal Limits Marine (Salinity &gt;= 28psu) Estuarine (Salinity = 0.5 to 28psu) Freshwater (Salinity &lt;= 0.5psu) Deepwater (-2m to -20m) Marine, Deep Estuarine, Subtidal Freshwater Subtidal (MLLW to -2m) Marine, Subtitdal Estuarine, Subtidal Freshwater Intertidal (MHHW to MLLW) Marine, Intertidal Estuarine, Intertidal Freshwater Figure 3.2: Demonstration of habitat zonation functions for delineating ecosystems based on tidal range, salinity, and the combined assessment for habitat types in the area surrounding the Great Egg Inlet, New Jersey. 3.3 Habitat-Style Modeling Philosophy Dozens of ecological modeling tools focus on coastal ecosystems. These models vary based on factors such as disciplinary perspective (e.g., hydrologic, geomorphic, ecological), the level of ecological hierarchy addressed (e.g., individuals, populations, communities, ecosystems), the basic approach to modeling (e.g., statistical, theoretical), input requirements (e.g., few parameters vs.Â extensive geospatial layers), the treatment of time and space (e.g., lumped vs.Â distributed), and the degree of development (e.g., long history vs.Â ad hoc). However, multiple gaps in these tools are the driving motivation for developing the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM). Comprehensive view of regional ecosystems: Many existing ecological models focus on a subset of regional ecosystems (e.g., estuarine subtidal, but not marine subtidal) or focal taxa (e.g., fish, but not seagrass). The large spatial scope of the USACE study requires seamless landscape coverage of the study areas, as well as a consistent approach for assessing multiple ecosystem types simultaneously. Connection to USACE management actions: Existing tools often emphasize important physical forcings on ecosystems without a direct connection to USACEs proposed project action. For instance, a model may include marsh response to sea level rise, but be unable to incorporate marsh response to sea level rise in the presence of a storm surge barrier. Indirect effects: Models often emphasize direct changes at a site-scale rather than indirect effects of off-site changes. For instance, a model may assess habitat quality associated with substrate, but be unable to link to changes in substrate as a result of distant infrastructure effects (e.g., a storm surge barrier). System-wide data: Many valuable ecological tools have been developed at small spatial scales based on detailed site data (e.g., vegetation surveys or field assessment procedures). However, the extremely large scale of these projects makes field data collection infeasible given time and resource limits, and NYBEM inputs must be available for the entire model extent. Rapid and phased application: The USACE studies are assessing project outcomes within limited analytical timeframes. Therefore certain tools that might be applicable on longer time horizons (i.e., years) are not feasible in these short periods (i.e., months). Given these challenges, the NYBEM seeks to build from the wide breadth of existing knowledge and models to develop a comprehensive set of tools that are directly applicable to the unique needs of planning USACE coastal storm risk management projects. The NYBEM draws from two distinct modeling approaches that are applicable at different scales. First, six patch-scale models are developed here, which use an index-based modeling philosophy assessing the quantity and quality of a given ecosystem type. Second, system-scale models will be developed in the future, which apply network-analytic methods to assess organismal connectivity. This report documents only the patch-scale models applicable in the six ecosystems shown in Table 3.2. The NYBEM takes a common approach to ecological modeling based on quantity and quality of habitat. Index models (Swannack, Fischbach, and Tazik 2012) were originally developed for species-specific habitat applications (e.g., slider turtles), but the general approach has also been adapted to guilds (e.g., salmonids), communities (e.g., floodplain vegetation), and ecosystem processes (e.g., the Hydrogeomorphic Method). An index-based modeling approach is used for multiple reasons. First, index models directly respond to changes in physical properties and provide a clear link to changes in ecosystem quantity and quality resulting from future conditions with and without proposed actions. Second, index-based models align well with a phased model development approach. Third, index-based models are familiar to USACE decision-makers from diverse applications in other regions such as Louisiana coastal restoration (i.e., the Wetland Value Assessment), California bay restoration (i.e., East San Pedro Bay), and Gulf Coast harbor expansion (i.e., Mobile Bay). Notably, these examples each assess multiple habitat types (e.g., oyster, seagrass) and aggregate outcomes into an overall metric of ecological impacts or benefits. In NYBEM, the quantity and quality of each ecosystem type are assessed separately. For instance, ecosystem extent and habitat quantity is rapidly delineated from modeled hydrodynamic conditions. Ecosystem quality is then assessed based on patch-specific data and known thresholds in ecological response (e.g., on a normalized 0 to 1 scale indicating ecological quality or function). The product of habitat quality and quantity provides a consistent metric across ecosystem types (i.e., habitat units). Here, the terms habitat and ecosystem are used synonymously to indicate a given location or patch on the landscape.

This chapter describes the NYBEM relative to model structure, the theoretical underpinnings of the six ecosystem-specific sub-models, and associated numerical tools. In general, the overarching quantitative architecture of the NYBEM can be summarized in three major elements (Figure 4.1). First, model inputs are assembled in a geospatial database. Second, the model code is prepared as a package in the R Statistical Software. Finally, the model outputs habitat quantity and quality as well as habitat units for each patch in the model domain. Figure 4.1: Quantitative architecture of the NYBEM. Variables input into NYBEM consist of three major groups of data layers. First, the spatial extent of a given model run must be defined. The NYBEM is constrained to applications within the region of the New York Bight watersheds (Section 2.1). Within that region, a focal area for the simulation must be specified, which can consist of a particular project boundary (e.g., NJBB or HATS) or a user-specified domain (e.g., a particular back bay). Within that focal area, the downstream and upstream extents of the model are specified based on the 20m ocean depth contour and Mean Higher High Water (MHHW), respectively. The second major group of input variables relate to hydrodynamics. These inputs may be computed over varying temporal windows (e.g., a month, a year, or a decade) depending on the project focus, and the inputs could be provided by a variety of hydrodynamic models or empirical data sources. Hydrodynamic variables characterize the bed elevation, water surface, salinity, and current velocity distributed throughout the project area. Third, a variety of environmental variables are compiled from national and regional data sets to inform habitat quality calculations. The second major element is the model itself. All model code for the NYBEM is contained within an R-package (nybem, available via github). Generally speaking, a package can be thought of as a fundamental unit of code that can include functions, data, documentation, and tests (Wickham and Bryan 2019). Packages then provide a transportable and reproducible mechanism for code sharing and publication. The nybem package contains three main pieces. Three functions are presented to map the six major habitat types relative to tidal range and salinity. Three more functions contain the computational engine for habitat suitability calculations. Finally, the data for seven different ecosystem-specific suitability models is stored in a list object. Section 4.1 describes the basis for delineating habitat zones, Sections 4.2-4.7 describe the theoretical (i.e., ecological) basis for assessing habitat quality in each zone, and Section 4.8 describes the numerical functions and code in detail. Each of the habitat quality sub-models followed a consistent set of development steps, which are documented throughout this chapter and briefly described here. Preliminary variables were identified at a series of interagency workshops through a series of conceptual modeling exercises (Appendix A). Additional variables were added based on taxa-specific habitat suitability models (i.e., USFWS blue books), relevant tools (e.g., New England Marsh Model), and literature review. A conceptual model was then developed for each ecosystem type to better understand how key variables interact. Regional and national data sets were consulted to ensure that model variables could be assessed throughout the broad spatial extent of the New York Bight, which limited the inclusion of many variables. Potential model variables were compiled along with the rationale for inclusion or exclusion. Finally, a numerical suitability index was developed for each variable remaining in the sub-model, which were based on existing suitability indices, published thresholds / responses, and professional judgment. The suitability indices should be thought of as generalized metrics of ecosystem condition rather than habitat suitability for a specific taxa. The language of suitability is adopted due to familiarity of decision-makers in the USACE and other environmental management organizations. The final major element of the modeling framework is the outputs. Ultimately, the nybem package allows users to assess the extent (i.e., quantity) and integrity (i.e., quality) of six major ecosystem types. The size and quality of a given habitat patch can provide useful metrics in their own right, or they may be summarized as an overarching habitat unit (i.e., the quantity of habitat in acres * patch quality assessed on a 0 to 1 scale). While nybem outputs these quantities, post-processing is often required outside of the model to interogate, summarize, and visualize outcomes. 4.1 Habitat Zonation Throughout this report, the terms habitat and ecosystem are used synonymously to describe a generally homogeneous classification of an integrated biotic, abiotic, and social system occurring in a given area. Six different ecosystem types are included in NYBEM, and this section describes how these conceptual ecosystems were numerically delineated. The generalized criteria for delineating ecosystems (Table 3.2) were reframed as a suite of logic statements for identifying the salinity zone, tidal zone, or ecosystem type / habitat zone for any given patch. Tidal zone (\\(Z_{tidal}\\)) is defined as a categorical metric of deep (1), subtidal (2), intertidal (3), and upland (4) classes. \\[Z_{tidal} = \\begin{pmatrix} deep(1) &amp; elev_{bed} &lt; -2m\\\\ subtidal(2) &amp; -2&lt;elev_{bed}&lt;MLLW\\\\ intertidal(3) &amp; MLLW&lt;elev_{bed}&lt;MHHW\\\\ upland(4) &amp; MHHW&lt;elev_{bed} \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(elev_{bed}\\) is bed elevation, \\(MLLW\\) is mean lower low water, \\(MHHW\\) is mean higher high water, and all elevations are presented relative to mean tide level. Salinity zone (\\(Z_{salinity}\\)) is defined as a categorical metric of marine (1), estuarine (2), and fresh (3) classes. \\[Z_{salinity} = \\begin{pmatrix} marine(1) &amp; sal_{10}&gt;28psu\\\\ estuarine(2) &amp; 28psu&gt;sal_{10}&gt;0.5psu\\\\ fresh(3) &amp; sal_{10}&lt;0.5psu \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(sal_{10}\\) is a representative low salinity (e.g., average annual low flow, 10th percentile) in practical salinity units (psus). Habitat zones (\\(Z_{habitat}\\)) may then be defined from logical combinations of tidal and salinity zones. \\[Z_{habitat} = \\begin{pmatrix} upland(1) &amp; Z_{tidal}=4\\\\ mar.deep(2) &amp; Z_{salinity}=1,Z_{tidal}=1\\\\ mar.sub(3) &amp; Z_{salinity}=1,Z_{tidal}=2\\\\ mar.int(4) &amp; Z_{salinity}=1,Z_{tidal}=3\\\\ est.sub(5) &amp; Z_{salinity}=2,Z_{tidal}=or(1,2)\\\\ est.int(6) &amp; Z_{salinity}=2,Z_{tidal}=3\\\\ fresh.tid(7) &amp; Z_{salinity}=3,Z_{tidal}=or(1,2,3) \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(upland\\) represents upland areas outside of the model domain, \\(mar.deep\\) represents marine, deepwater zones, \\(mar.sub\\) represents marine, subtidal zones, \\(mar.int\\) represents marine, intertidal zones, \\(est.sub\\) represents estuarine, subtidal zones, \\(est.int\\) represents estuarine, intertidal zones, and \\(fresh.tid\\) represents freshwater, tidal zones. 4.2 Freshwater, Tidal Zone Tidal freshwater marshes are found in the topmost region of the estuary where the entry of saltwater from tidal action is mitigated by a significantly higher amount of freshwater from upstream. These unique environments are highly influenced by inflows of freshwater and sediment from rivers. Salt concentrations in tidal freshwater are typically less than 0.5 psu, although larger salinity pulses can occur during spring tides or periods of extremely low river discharge. Tidal freshwater marshes provide significant nesting sites for a variety of species, including the marsh wren and other organisms dwelling in emergent vegetation. Sea-level rise pushes additional salinity into these systems, causing vegetation to shift and some tidal freshwater marshes to become oligohaline wetlands. Many migratory fish species also rely on this habitat as key resting and stopover areas during migration (Pasternack, Hilgartner, and Brush 2000). Mussels, sturgeon, herring, and marsh wren are some of the taxa of greatest management focus in this ecosystem. Figure 4.2 presents a conceptual model of the freshwater, tidal ecosystem. In general, this ecosystem can be thought of as strongly driven by marsh elevations and salinity regimes as well as its role as a key transitional habitat between freshwater and saltwater systems. Marsh elevations are governed by interlinked dynamics related to edge erosion, sediment deposition, and organic matter accretion. Salinity regimes are affected by the complex interplay of coastal connectivity and freshwater flows. Migratory processes can be thought of relative to physical barriers affecting pathways (e.g., culverts, tide gates) as well as the value of any given patch for supporting migration via resting and foraging. Figure 4.2: Conceptual model for the freshwater, tidal submodel. Within NYBEM, three general metrics are used to reflect these complex dynamics (Figure 4.3): salinity, vegetation cover, and sediment deposition. Salinity concentration influences many chemical and physical ecological processes within the tidal freshwater ecosystem and supports euryhaline organisms. Emergent vegetation coverage provides habitat, mitigates inland flooding, affects organic matter accretion, and supports water quality within the tidal freshwater ecosystem. Water depth fluctuations support sediment deposition that bring an influx of inorganic sediment and organic nutrients into the ecosystem to mitigate against sea level change. The overall habitat suitability of the freshwater, tidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these three metrics. \\(I_{fresh.tid} = \\frac{salinity + veg.cover + deposition}{3}\\) Where \\(I_{fresh.tid}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the freshwater, tidal zone, \\(salinity\\) is a suitability index relative to salinity, \\(veg.cover\\) is a suitability index relative to vegetative cover, and \\(deposition\\) is a suitability index relative to episodic deposition of sediment. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.3: Suitability index curves for the freshwater, tidal zone. 4.2.1 Salinity Freshwater tidal wetlands are regularly flooded marshes and swamps with water that is less saline than brackish. The salinity of the water varies from totally fresh to oligohaline (0 psu to 0.5 psu). Salinity influences physical and chemical processes such as flocculation and the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, as well as the types of organisms that reside in a freshwater tidal ecosystem. Hurricanes and other storms may bring brackish water into the system, which is a significant natural disturbance. Because many plant species in these wetlands are not tolerant to brackish conditions, vegetation can be harmed as a result of these occurrences. For NYBEM, the salinity regime is summarized through a metric of the percent of time salinity is greater than the freshwater tidal ecosystem threshold of 0.5 psu. These plant communities cannot withstand long periods of increased salinity (over 0.5 ppt). However, this approach assumes that although saltwater inputs serve as disturbance, some amount of saltwater input can stimulate marshes. Salinity may be computed or measured over an annual or multi-annual period. These data may then be summarized as an exceedence curve with thresholds from 0-100% in 10% intervals. This exceedence curve may then be used to calculate the percent of time salinity is greater than or equal to 0.5 psu. This duration metric is then translated into a suitability metric as follows: \\[salinity.high.dur = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.05*sal_{dur} &amp; sal_{dur}=0-20\\\\ 1.0 &amp; sal_{dur}=20-100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(salinity.high.dur\\) is a suitability index relative to high salinity periods and \\(sal_{dur}\\) is the percent of time salinity is greater than the threshold for freshwater tidal habitat (i.e., salinity &gt; 0.5 psu). 4.2.2 Vegetation Cover Freshwater tidal marshes are characterized by the dominance of herbaceous, shrubby, or emergent aquatic vegetation, with little tree canopy. Emergent vegetation coverage plays a crucial role in the ecosystem. For avian taxa like the marsh wren, reproductive appropriateness may be determined by the relative availability of emergent plants for nesting birds (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). Vegetation coverage within a freshwater marsh also provides crucial habitat to a variety of other unique animals and organisms. Further, excessively moist or dry periods can cause additional stress to vegetation leaving the habitat susceptible to a salt intrusion event which can destroy vegetation and make the habitat totally unsuitable. For the NYBEM tidal freshwater ecosystem submodel, vegetation cover is quantified as the percentage of emergent aquatic vegetation. Emergent aquatic vegetation is a key habitat resource for species found within this ecosystem like marsh wren, and marsh wren are a key indicator species of ecosystem health because they are drawn to ideal wetland conditions. These important avian taxa rarely breed in marshes with less than 57% emergent vegetation (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987), which is used as a threshold for declines (and increases) in ecosystem condition. However, marshes can continue to provide ecological functions even at low levels of vegetation cover, so ecosystem condition only declines to 0.1 for vegetation cover of 0% (following the example of CWPPRA 2007). The cover metric should be computed relative to a neighborhood effect of surrounding patches, which would be indicative of the general condition of the area surrounding the marsh patch. \\[veg.cover = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0070*cover_{per}+0.10 &amp; cover_{per}=0-57\\\\ 0.0116*cover_{per}-0.16 &amp; cover_{per}=57-100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(veg.cover\\) is a suitability index relative to vegetation coverage and \\(cover_{per}\\) is the percent of vegetation coverage. 4.2.3 Episodic Sediment Deposition Tidal oscillations control the short-term dynamics of freshwater tidal wetlands, which feed nutrients into the environment and make them more fruitful and productive than some non-tidal wetlands (Propato, Clough, and Polaczyk 2018). These tidal oscillations, as well as irregular weather events, deposit sediment and nutrients into the ecosystem. Increased inundation depths in tidal freshwater marshes can lead to more inorganic sediment deposition, which can assist tidal wetlands keep up with rising sea levels. As a result, marshes can migrate vertically to preserve their position in the tidal frame to some extent. This metric in NYBEM seeks to capture the benefits of episodic deposition of sediment relative to those of tidal flooding. Episodic sediment deposition requires large magnitude flooding events beyond typical tidal inundation. As such, we developed a metric to assess the relative difference in depth beyond the common tidal datum of MHHW (see equation below). This relative depth metric is one when flood magnitude is equal to MHHW, and the metric increases as flood magnitude increases beyond MHHW. The metric cannot be less than one because the maximum flood is, by definition, greater than a regularly occurring datum. \\[H_{rel} = \\frac{H_{max} - H_{median}}{H_{MHHW} - H_{median}}\\] Where \\(H_{rel}\\) is a relative depth metric assessing the role of episodic floods, \\(H_{max}\\) is the maximum depth observed over a period of record, \\(H_{median}\\) is the median depth observed over a period of record, and \\(H_{MHHW}\\) is the depth at mean higher high water. The relationship between relative depth and habitat suitability is shown below. We assume that low values of this metric lead to less sediment deposition and are therefore less preferred, and higher values are more ideal. Suitability levels off beyond \\[H_{rel}=2.0\\] because of a potential for extremely large storms to induce erosion rather than deposit sediment. \\[deposition = \\begin{pmatrix} H_{rel}-1.0 &amp; H_{rel}=1-2\\\\ 1.0 &amp; H_{rel}=2-5 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(deposition\\) is a suitability index relative to episodic sediment deposition and \\(H_{rel}\\) is the change in depth in meters. 4.2.4 Potential extension of freshwater, tidal model Freshwater, tidal ecosystems are complex, dynamic environments, and this NYBEM submodel provides a simple proxy for the relative integrity of these environments. Future improvements to this modeling approach could include the following: Organic matter accretion is important in freshwater tidal ecosystem, particularly for marsh adaptation under sea level change (Schile et al. (2014)). Accretion is characterized as the accumulation of plant material, including roots and degraded material, from plants growing in the marsh, as well as growth via deposition of suspended particles during floods (Schile et al. (2014)). Accretion rates are becoming a more common practice in sea level rise adaptation tools (e.g., Morris et al. (2002);Propato, Clough, and Polaczyk (2018)). -Edge erosion can also provide a key mechanism of marsh loss in some systems, and this process could be incorporate through hydrodynamic outputs or proxies such as fetch (Morris et al. (2002);Propato, Clough, and Polaczyk (2018)). Within NYBEM, freshwater tidal areas currently include all depth ranges of freshwater systems (e.g., large rivers, marshes, etc.). An important area of model improvement could arise through a more depth stratified approach to assessing freshwater tidal systems. 4.3 Estuarine, Intertidal Zone Estuarine environments include marine water that has been diluted by freshwater input to varying degrees (Prosser et al. 2018). Intertidal ecosystems are found between high and low tide, and thus experience varying influences from both upland and aquatic drivers and stressors. The estuarine intertidal ecosystem considers areas with salinity values from 0.5 to 28 psu and elevation from MHHW to MLLW. Tidal marshes are vegetated intertidal ecosystems found at the land-sea interface that serve as crucial transition zones for marine, freshwater, and terrestrial processes (Colombano et al. 2021). Their location exposes them to a number of environmental factors (e.g., ocean currents, watershed hydrology) and environmental gradients (e.g., salinity)(Lauchlan and Nagelkerken 2020). Figure 4.4 presents a general conceptual model of this system. Generally speaking, the function of these systems is highly related to sediment processes like edge erosion and episodic deposition, long-term shifts in salinity, and the role of these systems as transitional ecotones from fresh-salt water and upland-aquatic. Figure 4.4: Conceptual model for the estuarine, intertidal submodel. Within NYBEM, five metrics are used to reflect the condition of these systems related to edge erosion, vegetative cover, episodic sediment deposition, development of adjacent uplands, and the presence/absence of shoreline armoring. The overall habitat suitability of the estuarine, intertidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these five metrics. \\(I_{est.int} = \\frac{erosion + veg.cover + deposition + upland + shoreline}{5}\\) Where \\(I_{est.int}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the marine intertidal zone, \\(erosion\\) is a suitability index relative to the edge erosion, \\(veg.cover\\) is a suitability index relative to vegetative cover, \\(deposition\\) is a suitability index relative to episodic sediment deposition, \\(upland\\) is a suitability index relative to adjacent upland land uses, and \\(shoreline\\) is a suitability index relative to shoreline armoring. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.5: Suitability index curves for the estuarine, intertidal zone. 4.3.1 Edge Erosion Marsh sediment budgets are a geographically integrated measure of opposing constructive and destructive forces: a surplus of sediment can lead to vertical growth and/or lateral expansion, while a shortfall can lead to drowning and/or lateral contraction (Ganju et al. 2017). Many estuarine marshes face sediment deficits along the shoreline as a result of increased edge erosion. Edge degradation causes morphological changes that make it easier for waves to propagate to the marsh borders and promote the resuspension and export of sediments from the estuary (Li, Leonardi, and Plater 2019). A relative change in velocity from a baseline condition is used as a proxy for more complex edge erosion processes. This assumes that all things being equal, if currents and velocities increase significantly then erosion is likely to increase as well. Notably, increased velocity could result from a future without project condition (e.g., sea level rise), and decrease velocities could result from a future with project condition (e.g., a storm surge barrier). This metric is intended to capture the relative change from current conditions as a proxy for effects of alternative futures on edge erosion rates. We assume that any increase in high velocity conditions beyond 10% is detrimental, and that increases beyond 50% would fundamentally alter the character of a given marsh. These thresholds were based on input from technical workshops (Appendix A), but the values are largely based on professional judgment and should be reexamined in future models. Importantly, the change in velocity is measured for a high velocity condition, which would generally correlate with storm conditions when erosion would be likely. High velocity conditions are identified as the 90th percentile velocity over a period of record. \\[erosion = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; vel_{delta}&lt;10\\\\ -0.025*vel_{delta}+1.25 &amp; vel_{delta}=10-50\\\\ 0.0 &amp; vel_{delta}&gt;50 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(erosion\\) is a suitability index relative to edge erosion and \\(vel_{delta}\\) is the percent change in high velocity relative to a baseline condition. 4.3.2 Vegetation Cover Vegetation provides various ecological services within the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, including providing a fish nursery environment, food for migratory birds, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and sediment stability. The standing density of plant biomass or aboveground production has been demonstrated to result in a positive function in relation to the rate of change of elevation (Morris et al., 2002). Conversely, reductions of vegetative cover can have a significant impact on system functionality. The loss of vegetative cover changes the dynamics in locations that were formerly vegetated. This loss transforms areas of the estuary from a deposition and accretion-friendly environment to one that favors suspension and erosion. For estuaries, high amounts of suspended particles and sediment-associated nutrients create a variety of environmental management issues (Cotton et al. 2006). For the NYBEM estuarine intertidal submodel, habitat suitability increases as the percentage of vegetative cover increases throughout the habitat. Vegetation cover is quantified as the percentage of emergent aquatic vegetation, and the cover metric should be computed relative to a neighborhood effect of surrounding patches, which would be indicative of the general condition of the area surrounding the marsh patch and the marshes long-term sustainability. Marshes can continue to provide ecological functions even at low levels of vegetation cover, so ecosystem condition only declines to 0.1 for vegetation cover of 0% (following the example of CWPPRA 2007). \\[veg.cover = 0.9*cover_{per}+0.1\\] Where \\(veg.cover\\) is a suitability index relative to vegetation cover and \\(cover_{per}\\) is the percent of vegetation coverage. 4.3.3 Episodic Sediment Deposition Estuaries are efficient sediment traps. Marine materials are deposited from the continental shelf into estuarine, littoral habitats. Due to disparities in tidal currents (ebb versus flood tide), sediments are carried to supply sediment on varying time frames. In the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, sediment transport capacity is mostly determined by river discharge, by the timing of discharge events in relation to the springneap cycle, and subtidal oscillations in sea level (Prosser et al. 2018). Periodic flood and storm events are major drivers in sediment dynamics and contribute disproportionately to the total sediment discharge (Ralston et al. 2013). During these episodes of retreating salinity intrusions and increasing bed pressures, sediment deposition episodes can induce considerable bed resuspension in the estuary. The duration of high-discharge episodes in relation to the estuarine reaction time, a feature that fluctuates seasonally with discharge and estuarine length, also affects sediment transport capacity (Palinkas et al. 2014). These short-term events can cause changes in the local biological community and affect seabed stability and strength. These events then affect sediment mixing and activation which affect water infiltration and exfiltration through the sediment (Nancy Jackson, Karl Nordstorm, and David R. Smith 2010). During storms, erosion of the shoreline can result in the removal of material from the upper foreshore and deposition on the lower foreshore, or the foreshore moving horizontally landward. The influx of additional nutrients following an episode of sediment deposition have been known to cause harmful algal blooms (HABs)(Ralston et al. 2014). Further, the frequent upturn of sediment can displace biological organisms. The relationship between sediment deposition and water level rise can be used to quantify habitat suitability within the esturarine intertidal ecosystem. When water level increases, sediment deposition will be at an optimal level to support esturarine intertidal habitat. Episodic sediment deposition requires large magnitude flooding events beyond typical tidal inundation. This metric in NYBEM seeks to capture the benefits of episodic deposition of sediment relative to those of tidal flooding. Episodic sediment deposition requires large magnitude flooding events beyond typical tidal inundation. As such, we developed a metric to assess the relative difference in depth beyond the common tidal datum of MHHW (see equation below). This relative depth metric is one when flood magnitude is equal to MHHW, and the metric increases as flood magnitude increases beyond MHHW. The metric cannot be less than one because the maximum flood is, by definition, greater than a regularly occurring datum. \\[H_{rel} = \\frac{H_{max} - H_{median}}{H_{MHHW} - H_{median}}\\] Where \\(H_{rel}\\) is a relative depth metric assessing the role of episodic floods, \\(H_{max}\\) is the maximum depth observed over a period of record, \\(H_{median}\\) is the median depth observed over a period of record, and \\(H_{MHHW}\\) is the depth at mean higher high water. The relationship between relative depth and habitat suitability is shown below. We assume that low values of this metric lead to less sediment deposition and are therefore less preferred, and higher values are more ideal. Suitability levels off beyond \\[H_{rel}=2.0\\] because of a potential for extremely large storms to induce erosion rather than deposit sediment. \\[deposition = \\begin{pmatrix} H_{rel}-1.0 &amp; H_{rel}=1-2\\\\ 1.0 &amp; H_{rel}=2-5 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(deposition\\) is a suitability index relative to episodic sediment deposition and \\(H_{rel}\\) is the change in depth in meters. 4.3.4 Developement of Adjacent Upland Land use intensity corresponds to the degree of land transformation caused by technological and economic measures, in addition to urbanization (Ge et al., 2021). Changes in land use intensity can have major impacts on the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles, and biodiversity and ecological services (Yan et al., 2017). Estuaries serve as a natural buffer between an upland and the coastal areas by filtering urban and agricultural runoff and trapping sediments that can harm aquatic life, absorbing and slowing floodwaters, absorbing wave energy and slowing down currents via wetland plants, all of which prevent erosion and stabilize the shoreline (Ji, 2007). A wetlands value is also greater if it is located near other natural habitats, and that value increases with the degree of connectivity to and complexity of associated habitats (Mckinney et al., 2009a). Furthermore, the development of uplands within a watershed can have a direct and indirect impact on a variety of essential aspects in estuarine intertidal ecosystems. The combination of coastal erosion and upland development causes a coastal squeeze, in which low-lying, intertidal regions, that would usually recede inland in the face of sea-level rise, are diminished because man-made structures (e.g.Â shoreline armoring) prevent such retreat (Prosser et al. 2018). Land management methods on the tidal marshs upland border can help or hinder ecosystem migration in response to increasing sea levels (Anisfeld, Cooper, and Kemp 2017). Heavy pressure from residential development can also alter system salinity and induce a shift in community types (Anthony et al., 2009). Neighboring land use intensity can conservatively be estimated by the relative amount of anthropocentric development pressures within a given buffer from a site. Generally, undeveloped uplands have a positive impact on the resilience of an ecosystem. Inversely, adjacency to developed uplands is correlated with a decrease in ecosystem health associated with a greater degree of fragmentation between systems (Wolanski et al., 2009), with a decreases in habitat suitability beyond 10% of adjacent uplands developed. For the NYBEM, habitat suitability is modeled as a function of urban development for adjacent uplands. When the percentage of adjacent urban land uses is greater than 10%, habitat suitability in the estuarine intertidal ecosystem declines. When the development of adjacent upland reaches 100% of the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, the habitat is no longer be considered suitable. \\[land.use = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; urban_{per}=0-10\\\\ -0.011*urban_{per}+1.11 &amp; urban_{per}=10-100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(land.use\\) is a suitability index relative to adjacent upland land uses and \\(urban_{per}\\) is the percent of adjacent upland in developed (i.e., urban) land uses within 100m. 4.3.5 Shoreline Armoring Natural biological processes and human-induced changes to the estuarine intertidal shoreline boundary are considered as components to a complex ecological system. The mean high-tide line is commonly used to determine shoreline boundaries and extent (Kittinger and Ayers 2010). Shoreline modification called armoring has resulted in a considerable loss of coastal ecosystems from erosion, as well as a reduction in the resilience of these systems to disturbance (Kittinger and Ayers 2010). Shoreline armoring involves placing hardened structures like bulkheads and revetments along the shoreline and as sea levels rise, these structures can prevent coastal marshes from spreading upland over time (Gardner and Johnston 2021). Armoring is widespread throughout the United States, with extensive armoring found near urban areas (Morley, Toft, and Hanson 2012). Shoreline armoring occupies 50-70% of shorelines along urban coastal areas (Dugan et al. 2018). Increasing shoreline development pressure and predicted sea-level rise suggest that the demand for shoreline armoring will continue to rise and expand throughout the future (Gardner and Johnston 2021). Shoreline armoring is correlated with decreased habitat complexity, and a reduction in connectivity to adjacent habitats (Morley, Toft, and Hanson 2012). The environmental consequences of armoring are context dependent, relying on characteristics of the environment and armoring structural factors (Dugan et al. 2018). The type of structure placed (e.g., seawalls, bulkheads, revetments, libing shorelines) and its relative placement on the coast profile will influence the biological reactions to armoring. For the NYBEM, estuarine intertidal habitats that lack shoreline armoring are assumed to have increased habitat suitability. The distance to the nearest armored shoreline is used as a proxy to predict the ability for multiple taxa to use the shoreline as migratory pathways. This metric also serves as a proxy for other forms of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., stormwater input). \\[shoreline = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.05*dist_{armor}+0.5 &amp; dist_{armor}=0-100m\\\\ 1.0 &amp; dist_{armor}&gt;100m \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(shoreline\\) is a suitability index relative to shoreline armoring and \\(dist_{armor}\\) is the distance to the nearest armored shoreline in meters. 4.3.6 Potential extension of estuarine, intertidal models Estuarine, intertidal ecosystems are incredibly well-studied environments, and many methods exist for assessing this system. NYBEM combines a few common metrics to obtain a general representation of ecosystem condition. However, future analyses could be expanded to include the following: Field-based protocols (e.g., Bartoldus 1994, McKinney et al.Â 2009ab, Raposa et al.Â 2018) are available for this system, and methods could be adapted to incorporate field-style processes into models through remote sensing or proxy variables. The intertidal zone could be further subdivided to capture differences in tidal flats, low marsh, high marsh, and other subdivisions of this important ecosystem. 4.4 Estuarine, Subtidal Zone This section presents development of the estuarine, subtidal submodel. Estuarine subtidal habitat was defined as areas with elevations between MLLW and -20m with salinities ranging from 0.5 to 28 psu. This submodel seeks to capture the general condition and trajectory of the estuarine subtidal habitat using three different taxa (oysters, submerged aquatic vegetation/SAV, and clams) as indicators of ecosystem quality, each of which provides critical contributions to the overall quality of the ecosystem. Given this indicator species approach, habitat quality is defined relative to these three taxas needs based on existing suitability criteria. A conceptual model of the estuarine subtidal habitat was developed at a mediated modeling workshop (Appendix A). The conceptual model represented the major components affecting ecosystem quality, and three main categories of drivers were identified: physical (water quality, velocity, sedimentation), anthropogenic (vessel traffic and development stress), and biological (SAV, benthic organisms, fish) with interactions among the categories. Conceptual models were then refined in two key ways (Figure 4.6). First, it was assumed that fish habitat quality would be sufficient if oysters, SAV, and clams habitat needs were met, so this variable was removed. Second, substrate type is a major driver of SAV, oysters, and clams and became a point of stratification within the model. The ecosystem was coarsely divided into hard bottom and soft bottom habitats roughly correlated with oysters and SAV/clams, respectively. The unique characteristics and drivers of these habitats led to splitting the estuarine subtidal sub-model into modules for each of these substrate types. Figure 4.6: Conceptual model for the estuarine, subtidal submodel. The model was split into hard and soft bottom habitats (est.sub.hard and est.sub.soft, respectively). Hard bottom substrates are crucial for oyster reef establishment and recruitment. Historically, this region had a wide distribution of hard bottom substrate, but anthropogenic influences on water quality, sedimentation, and overfishing have reduced the extent significantly. Here, we use a historical map of oyster reef extent as a proxy for hard bottom with the assumption that hard substrate is relatively immobile and these locations would likely have higher potential for oyster reestablishment. Additional substrates such as gravel, cobble, or ledge provide important habitat and ecological functions, but these habitats were not considered due to a lack of data availability for the large focal area. 4.4.1 Hard Bottom Habitats Oysters are a major indicator of the integrity of hard bottom habitats in the New York Bight, and the hard bottom submodel is represented by an adaptation of the Oyster Habitat Suitability Index Model (OHSIM, Swannack, Reif, and Soniat (2014)). The OHSIM is a USACE-certified model for the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). OHSIM is a spatially-explicit, grid-based index model that uses a series of linear equations to calculate habitat suitability for C. virginica. The model consists of four variables: (1) hard substrate or cultch, (2) mean salinity during spawning season, in which spawning and spat set have a higher optimal salinity than for survival of adults, (3) annual mean salinity, which is the expected range over which adult oysters are viable, and (4) minimum annual salinity, which defines the impacts of high mortality events resulting from lower salinities due to freshwater influxes (Soniat et al. 2012). Variables are briefly described below, and more details can be found in Swannack, Reif, and Soniat (2014) and USACE model certification reports. For the NYBEM, spawning season salinity data were not available, so only three variables are used. The overall habitat suitability of the estuarine, subtidal, hard bottom ecosystem is aggregated into a single metric via a geometric mean of these three suitability indices (following the OHSIM). \\(I_{est.sub.hard} = {(cultch * sal.min.ann * sal.mean.ann)}^{1/3}\\) Where \\(I_{est.sub.hard}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the estuarine, subtidal, hard bottom habitats, \\(cultch\\) is a suitability index relative to hard bottom composition, \\(sal.min.ann\\) is a suitability index relative to minimum annual salinity, and \\(sal.mean.ann\\) is a suitability index relative to mean annual salinity. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.7: Suitability index curves for hard bottom habitats in the esturaine, subtidal zone. 4.4.1.1 Oyster Substrate Cultch is hard substrate that provides points of attachment and recruitment for spat. Substrate is represented as the percent of the bottom covered with hard substrate, such as existing reefs, or other hard surfaces. We assume that oyster habitat suitability increases linearly from 0 to 100% cultch cover. \\[cultch = 0.01*hard_{per}\\] Where \\(cultch\\) is a suitability index relative to hard bottom composition and \\(hard_{per}\\) is the percent of the substrate that is hard bottom. 4.4.1.2 Minimum Annual Salinity Per Swannack, Reif, and Soniat (2014), Minimum Annual Salinity (MAS) is the minimum value of the 12 monthly mean salinities. This variable is essential to describe freshwater impacts (e.g., freshets, high rainfall years, or freshwater diversions) on oysters and is analogous to the frequency of killing floods variable used by Cake (1983). For NYBEM, we use a representative low salinity (i.e., the tenth percentile, \\(sal_{10}\\)) rather than a minimum of monthly average. The relationship between MAS and its suitability index is formulated as a linear step-function as follows: \\[sal.min.ann = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; MAS=0-2\\\\ 0.025*MAS-0.05 &amp; MAS=2-4\\\\ 0.225*MAS-0.85 &amp; MAS=4-6\\\\ 0.250*MAS-1.00 &amp; MAS=6-8\\\\ 1.0 &amp; MAS&gt;8 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(sal.min.ann\\) is a suitability index relative to minimum annual salinity, \\(MAS\\) is the minimum value of the 12 monthly mean salinities, and \\(sal_{10}\\) is the tenth percentile of an annual time series of salinity values, a proxy for MAS. 4.4.1.3 Annual Mean Salinity Annual Mean Salinity (AS) represents the range of salinities over which adult oysters are viable (Cake 1983). The relationship between AS and its suitability index is formulated as a linear step-function as follows: \\[sal.mean.ann = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; AS=0-5\\\\ 0.2*AS-1.00 &amp; AS=5-10\\\\ 1.00 &amp; AS=10-15\\\\ 0.08*AS-2.2 &amp; AS=15-20\\\\ 0.07*AS-2.0 &amp; AS=20-25\\\\ 0.03*AS-1.0 &amp; AS=25-30\\\\ 0.01*AS-0.4 &amp; AS=30-40\\\\ 0.0 &amp; AS&gt;40 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(sal.mean.ann\\) is a suitability index relative to mean annual salinity and \\(AS\\) is the mean annual salinity. 4.4.2 Soft Bottom Habitats Estuarine, subtidal soft bottom habitats comprise large portions of the study areas and host a variety of taxa of interest to environmental management. Specifically, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds and hard clams are key targets of management. However, these two outcomes have different ecological drivers. As such, the soft bottom model represents a hybridized approach that attempts to assess the general condition of this habitat type relative to both major outcomes. Habitat suitability is assessed separately for SAV and hard clams. The overall habitat suitability of the estuarine, subtidal, soft bottom ecosystem is aggregated into a single metric via a maximum of the separate suitability indices. This approach assumes that a given patch does not need to be perfect for both taxa simultaneously, but instead, the habitat could have high quality relative to one or the other outcome. \\(I_{est.sub.soft} = max({I_{sav},I_{clam})}\\) Where \\(I_{est.sub.soft}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the estuarine, subtidal, soft bottom habitats, \\(I_{sav}\\) is a suitability index relative to submerged aquatic vegetation, and \\(I_{clam}\\) is a suitability index relative to hard clams. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. 4.4.2.1 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Module Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is, generally speaking, a broad grouping of taxa including seagrasses, macroalgae, and other producers, which provide unique habitat structure and ecological function. In NYBEM, a more narrow view of SAV is considered, which focuses broadly on seagrasses and specifically on Zostera marina. The SAV model is represented by three variables critical for growth and reproduction of seagrass, (1) substrate, (2) light availability, and (3) development stress. Suitability scores are represented either as discrete categories or as step functions with linear interpolations between steps. \\(I_{sav} = \\frac{substrate.sav + light + vessel.density}{3}\\) Where \\(I_{sav}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation, \\(substrate.sav\\) is a suitability index relative to fine substrate, \\(light\\) is a suitability index relative to light penetration, and \\(vessel.density\\) is a suitability index relative to boat traffic and human uses (a proxy for development stress). All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.8: Suitability index curves for seagrass in soft bottom habitats in the esturaine, subtidal zone. Substrate is represented as the presence of soft-bottom sediments conducive for SAV growth. Based on Short et al.Â (2002), optimal conditions for growth were identified as non-cobble substrates with less than 70% fine sediment. Soft-bottom, non-cobble substrates with greater than 70% fine sediment were considered sub-optimal/adequate. Notably, the suitability index is 0.1 when fines are 100% to indicate the value of fine sediment patches as part of a habitat mosaic (Kritzer et al.Â 2016). Suitability scores for SAV substrate are represented as follows: \\[substrate.sav = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; fines_{per}=0-70\\\\ -0.030*fines_{per}+3.10 &amp; fines_{per}&gt;70\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(substrate.sav\\) is a suitability index relative to fine substrate and \\(fines_{per}\\) is the percent of fine substrate (silt and clay). Light availability drives photosynthesis in SAV. Light attenuates within the water column based on depth and water clarity (i.e., the deeper and more turbid the water, the less light reaches the bottom). For the this model, light availability depends on depth and is calculated algorithmically, then converted into a suitability index. Light availability (\\(I_{z}\\)) at the plant surface is estimated based on Nes et al. (2003) is calculated as follows: \\[I_{z} = PAR * exp(-K_{d}*z)\\] where \\(PAR\\) represents the photosynthetically active radiation at the surface, \\(K_{d}\\) is the light attenuation coefficient for water clarity matching the conditions of the study site, and \\(z\\) is water depth. Light attenuation in aquatic systems is a long studied process, although direct measurement of an extinction coefficient (\\(K_{d}\\)) remains less common. However, Secchi disk depth (\\(z_{sd}\\)) is a common surrogate for light extinction, and \\(K_{d}\\) is often estimated (Idso and Gilbert 1974) as: \\[K_{d} = 1.7 / z_{sd}\\] Where \\(z_{sd}\\) is Secchi depth in meters. Secchi depth would vary depending on algal productivity, sediment load, water color, and other factors. However, we adopt a regional guideline as a general boundary condition for desirable water clarity. New York State does not have an official standard for Secchi depth, but the state Department of Health requires 1.22 meters (4 feet) of clarity to locate a swimming beach (lake_george_water_2022?). This depth does not represent growth requirements of seagrasses, but it does provide a regionally specific goal for what is perceived as good water clarity. This assumption should be revisited in future model applications. This general target aligns with ranges of observations of Secchi depth for the region (DEP_harbor_2017?). Using this standard as a generalized guide for the region, light extinction may be calculated as shown below. \\[K_{d} = 1.7 / 1.22 = 1.39\\] \\[PLA = exp(-K_{d}*z) = exp(-1.39 *z)\\] Where \\(z\\) is depth in meters. Light at the plant surface is converted to a percent of light available (PLA) at that depth, which is used to calculate a suitability score. \\[PLA = \\frac{I_{z}}{PAR} * 100\\] The relationship between PLA and its suitability index for SAV is represented as follows. Notably, some studies have indicated a potential saturation effect of light at extremely high PLA (Thayer and Fonseca 1984); however, light is more likely to be limiting and the suitability curve reflects the more parsimonious situation in which lack of light is a limiting factor. \\[light = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; PLA&lt;10\\\\ 0.0833*PLA-0.83 &amp; 10&lt;PLA&lt;22\\\\ 1.0 &amp; PLA&gt;22\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(light\\) is a suitability index relative to light penetration and \\(PLA\\) is percent light available. Human-mediated disturbances can negatively impact SAV abundance. Many metrics of human disturbance exist quantifying issues like upland urban development, waterway usage, fishing pressures, water quality, and other outcomes. For the purpose of NYBEM, a simple metric of vessel density is used as a proxy for waterway use with the assumption that, all things being equal, a more used waterway is likely to have other anthropogenic pressures (e.g., spills, boat induced waves, etc.). We quantify these disturbances through a proxy of vessel traffic per year. Vessel traffic is obtained from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) database. Thresholds in use were determined by visually inspecting AIS data. Lower traffic (less than 1,000 tracks per year) is considered optimal and the suitability decreases with increasing vessel traffic. Suitability scores for are quantified as follows: \\[vessel.density = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; ves_{AIS}=0-1000\\\\ -0.0001*ves_{AIS}+1.1 &amp; ves_{AIS}=1000-10000\\\\ 0.1 &amp; ves_{AIS}&gt;10000 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(vessel.density\\) is a suitability index relative to ship traffic and \\(ves_{AIS}\\) is the annual vessel tracks over a patch from the Automated Information System. 4.4.2.2 Hard Clam Module The hard clam habitat suitability submodel is based on an adaptation of Thompson et al.Â (2021). These authors map hard clam habitat suitability based on salinity, seagrass coverage, flow rates, substrate, cholophyll a, harvesting rates, depth, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. They report ideal depth for hard clams as 4 to 8 m with marginal outcomes in shallower depths, but for this model, depth is assumed to span the entire subtidal range. Only three of the variables recommended by Thompson et al.Â (2021) were feasible in this analysis: (1) salinity, (2) substrate, and (3) SAV suitability. Data limited the use of all other variables across the large spatial domain of NYBEM. All variables were translated from categorical to continuous suitability scales as follows: optimal (1.0), acceptable (0.75), marginal (0.25), and unsuitable (0.0). The three variables were combined into a single index of ecosystem condition as follows: \\(I_{clam} = \\frac{salinity.clam + substrate.clam + sav.prob}{3}\\) Where \\(I_{clam}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to hard clam habitat, \\(salinity.clam\\) is a suitability index relative to salinity, \\(substrate.clam\\) is a suitability index relative to fine substrate, and \\(sav.prob\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation coverage. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.9: Suitability index curves for clams in soft bottom habitats in the esturaine, subtidal zone. The salinity metric describes the range of salinities over which clams can survive. Optimal salinity for hard clams ranges from 25 to 35 psu. Hyper- and hypo-saline conditions (&gt; 45 or &lt;12.5 psu, respectively) are considered unsuitable when clams are exposed to these conditions for three to six consecutive days. Habitat suitability increases with increasing salinity for intermediate values. The relationship between salinity and its suitability index is formulated as follows: \\[salinity.clam = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; MAS=0-12\\\\ 0.5*MAS-6.0 &amp; MAS=12-12.5\\\\ 0.033*MAS-0.17 &amp; MAS=12.5-20\\\\ 0.1*MAS-1.5 &amp; MAS=20-25\\\\ 1.0 &amp; MAS=25-35\\\\ -0.1*MAS+4.5 &amp; MAS=12.5-20\\\\ 0.0 &amp; MAS&gt;45 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(salinity.clam\\) is a suitability index relative to salinity and \\(MAS\\) is mean annual salinity. Similar to seagrass and oysters, substrate is a critical parameter for hard clam viability. Optimal substrate is shelly soft bottom. As the substrate composition increases in fine sediment composition, the substrate becomes less suitable for clams. Suitability scores for clam substrate are quantified as follows: \\[substrate.clam = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0050*fines_{per}+1.00 &amp; fines_{per}=0-50\\\\ -0.0125*fines_{per}+1.38 &amp; fines_{per}=50-90\\\\ -0.0250*fines_{per}+2.50 &amp; fines_{per}=90-100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(substrate.clam\\) is a suitability index relative to fine substrate and \\(fines_{per}\\) is fine sediment composition of the substrate (%fines). Optimal habitat for hard clams is sandy bottom without seagrass. As seagrass coverage increases, the suitability for clams decreases. Given a lack of comprehensive seagrass mapping in the region and an ability to forecast through time, we use the seagrass habitat suitability as a proxy (\\(I_{SAV}\\)). The relationship between seagrass suitability and hard clam suitability is formulated as follows: \\[sav.prob = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; I_{sav}=0-0.2\\\\ -1.667*I_{sav}+1.33 &amp; I_{sav}=0.2-0.8\\\\ 0.0 &amp; I_{sav}=0.8-1.0 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(sav.prob\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation coverage and \\(I_{clam}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality relative to submerged aquatic vegetation coverage. 4.4.3 Potential extension of estuarine, subtidal model As described, the estuarine subtidal ecosystem is a complex environment with multiple ecological outcomes of interest. Any model represents a simplifying set of assumptions, and future modeling could be extended in multiple ways. This submodel makes extensive use of indicator species (i.e., oyster, clam, seagrass), and the use of those taxa and alignment with management objectives should be examined. Th hard bottom model relies on an oyster habitat suitability model, although mean salinity during spawning season was omitted from the NYBEM formulation. This process reflects the higher optimal salinities required for spawning and larval stages (Butler (1954),Cake (1983)) and is an important part of the OHSIM framework, which could be expanded with a more temporally distributed view of processes within NYBEM. Similarly, the soft bottom model omits some important variables and processes such as: Temperature for SAV: Temperature is not presently included but represents a crucial variable for both SAV and clams. Like all vascular plants, temperature is a major driver for SAV viability. At low temperatures, physiological processes are constrained, while metabolic temperature increases with higher temperatures (Staehr et al.Â 2011). At temperatures above optimal range for SAV, metabolic activity is significantly reduced or halted as a result of protein denaturation or inactivation (Atkin (2003), Jensen et al. (2000)). Temperature for Clams: Water temperature can have significant impacts on hard clams. For future models, temperatures below biological zero (5Â°C) and above 33Â°C are likely unsuitable. Temperatures between 12.5Â°C and above 32Â°C range in suitability with optimal temperatures between 22.5Â°C and 30Â°C. 4.5 Marine, Intertidal Zone Marine, intertidal ecosystems include the areas of high salinity (&gt; 28 psu) bracketed by tidal limits of the mean higher high water (MHHW) and mean lower low water (MLLW). In the context of NYBEM, these systems tend to directly front the Atlantic Ocean as beaches or occur in high salinity zones near inlets. Figure 4.10 presents a conceptual model of the marine, intertidal ecosystem. For NYBEM, we focus the assessment of habitat quality primarily on sandy beaches due to the large extent of this habitat type in the region. This nearshore ecosystem is strongly influenced by two major pressures, the physical drivers of the ocean environment (e.g., currents, sediment transport) and human uses of the system (e.g., beaches and associated upland development). Ecologically, this ecosystem hosts a variety of species of management interest such as horseshoe crabs and shorebirds (e.g., piping plover, terns, red knot). Coastal storm risk management actions have the potential to affect this ecosystem through two primary mechanisms. First, some risk management actions (e.g., storm surge barriers) could be directly constructed in this area. Second, large-scale features have the potential to alter coastal dynamics indirectly, although this affect may occur to a lesser extent given the overarching dominance of ocean effects. Figure 4.10: Conceptual model for the marine, intertidal submodel. The tension between human uses of this landscape and ecological outcomes has long been acknowledged, and many models have been developed to assess ecological outcomes in marine, intertidal zones of the region, specifically for sandy beaches. This submodel drew heavily from four general bodies of knowledge, specifically: USFWS Habitat Evaluation Procedure models: tern (USFWS) (2001), Plover ((USFWS) 2001), Horseshoe Crab ((USFWS) 2001), and Red Knot ((USFWS) 2001). Other habitat suitability models: Plover Seavey, Gilmer, and McGarigal (2011), Horseshoe Crab Lathrope et al. (2013), and amaranth (Sellars and Jolls 2007) (upper intertidal only) Fire Island to Montauk Point Habitat Evaluation Procedure OceanBeach Sub-Model (USACE 2009). Empirical studies of the system: Virginia Tech shorebird program (Herman et al. 2019), Rutgers Horseshoe Crab Mapping (Lathrope et al. 2013), and International Shorebird Survey (Manomet). Four classes of processes and dynamics were identified from a review of these models and studies: long-term and large-scale wave and sediment dynamics, beach morphology, benthic food supplies, and the role of this system as a corridor between aquatic and upland environments. From these processes, four surrogate metrics were identified, which collectively reflect the condition of the marine, intertidal zone. Notably, variables reflecting wave and sediment dynamics are minimally included in this phase of modeling due to assessment challenges. The sections below describe each metric and the rationale in detail, but briefly: Beach slope was identified as a proxy for larger effects on overall morphology and grain size. The proportion of time a beach is exposed provides a metric of benthic food supplies and availability of foraging habitat. Upland land use intensity and shoreline armoring metrics describe the general human use pressures on a given system and viability of corridor functions. The overall habitat suitability of the marine, intertidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these metrics. \\(I_{mar.int} = \\frac{beach.slope + exp.dur + land.use + shoreline}{4}\\) Where \\(I_{mar.int}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the marine intertidal zone, \\(beach.slope\\) is a suitability index relative to beach slope, \\(exp.dur\\) is a suitability index relative to the duration of beach exposure, \\(land.use\\) is a suitability index relative to adjacent upland land uses, and \\(shoreline\\) is a suitability index relative to shoreline armoring. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.11: Suitability index curves for the marine, intertidal zone. 4.5.1 Beach Slope Beach morphology directly affects habitat use by multiple focal taxa (e.g., shorebirds, turtles, horseshoe crab). Beach shape and morphologic character can be described through parameters of width, slope, elevation, and other summaries of topography (Bridges et al. 2015). Beach width is indirectly captured in NYBEM through metrics of habitat quantity and patch size and is not considered here. Beach slope integrates morphologic outcomes and is directly tied to grain size and wave environment (Lodder et al. 2021). Beach slope, thus, provides an important and synthetic metric of marine, intertidal habitat quality. Beach slope would only be directly altered for actions in the intertidal zone, but it is included here as a general proxy for intertidal ecosystem condition. Beach slope is identified as a general indicator of ecosystem condition for Long Island ecosystems (USACE (2009)), and as an important driving component of habitat use by multiple taxa in the New York Bight. Specifically, habitat is most suitable for horseshoe crabs between ~5-10% slopes (Brady and Schrading 1996). Notably, not all taxa may respond in kind to these generalization. NYBEM assesses suitability relative to beach slope as follows: \\[beach.slope = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; slope_{per}=0-10\\\\ -0.05*slope_{per}+1.5 &amp; slope_{per}=10-30\\\\ 0.0 &amp; slope_{per}&gt;30 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(beach.slope\\) is a suitability index relative to beach slope and \\(slope_{per}\\) is the slope of the beach perpendicular to the mean tide line in percent. 4.5.2 Exposure Duration Intertidal zones are a key foraging habitat for shorebirds. The benthic food availability is related in part to soil moisture (Brady and Schrading 1996) and the time to forage in these zones. Soil moisture is also a key determinant of horseshoe crab spawning (Avissar 2006). For instance, in the lower intertidal, we would anticipate higher density of food but less exposure time for foraging; conversely, the higher intertidal would experience lower density of benthic resources but longer exposure time. For NYBEM, a proxy variable is used to account for these processes. Specifically, a ratio of depth ranges to the tidal range is used as a relative duration of exposure, which we calculate as follows: \\[t_{rel} = \\frac{H_{max} - H_{min}}{MHHW-MLLW}\\] Where \\(t_{rel}\\) is a relative duration of exposure, \\(H_{max}\\) is the maximum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, \\(H_{min}\\) is the minimum depth observed over a hydrodynamic simulation period, \\(MHHW\\) is mean higher high water, and \\(MLLW\\) is mean lower low water. This metric provides a relative accounting for the amount of exposure a given path experiences. For instance, \\(t_{rel}&gt;1\\) occurs in portions of the intertidal that remain underwater most of the time, and \\(t_{rel}=0\\) occurs in areas where the elevation exceeds the intertidal range. In terms of habitat suitability, we assume that ideal values of this metric occur near the mean tide level (\\(0.25&lt;t_{rel}&lt;0.75\\)) and suitability declines on either side of this plateau as follows: \\[exp.dur = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.04*t_{rel} &amp; t_{rel}&lt;0.25\\\\ 1.0 &amp; 0.25&lt;t_{rel}&lt;0.75\\\\ -0.04*t_{rel}+4.0 &amp; t_{rel}&gt;0.75 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(exp.dur\\) is a suitability index relative to exposure duration. 4.5.3 Upland Land Use Marine, intertidal zones are a key transitional habitat between aquatic and upland systems. Fully functional intertidal areas would include high-quality adjacent uplands and subtidal areas. A variety of surrogates have been used to assess human impacts on this system, including diverse metrics like foot traffic, vehicle use of beaches, beach grooming and maintenance practices, physical barriers along the beach (Farmer et al. 2000); direct human development such as buildings; trash and debris presence (USACE 2009); and general levels of land use intensity (Seavey, Gilmer, and McGarigal 2011). For the NYBEM, habitat suitability is modeled based on a relative metric of development for adjacent uplands within 100m. When the percentage of developed adjacent uplands is greater than 10%, habitat suitability in the estuarine intertidal ecosystem declines. When the development of adjacent upland reaches 100% of the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, the habitat will no longer be considered suitable. \\[land.use = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; urban_{per}=0-10\\\\ -0.011*urban_{per}+1.11 &amp; urban_{per}=10-100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(land.use\\) is a suitability index relative to adjacent upland land uses and \\(urban_{per}\\) is the percent of adjacent upland in developed (i.e., urban) land uses within 100m. 4.5.4 Shoreline Armoring Intertidal areas provide important habitat corridors for organism movement. However, shoreline armoring such as bulkheads or revetments can inhibit movement of the resident taxa (as well as the ecosystem migrating inland with sea level change). Numerous authors have highlighted the negative role that shoreline armoring can play in marine intertidal systems Lathrope et al. (2013). Ideal habitat suitability would occur in the absence of shoreline armoring, but many shorelines are extensively hardened in the developed New York Bight region. For NYBEM, the distance to the nearest armored shoreline is used as a relative measure of habitat suitability. Habitat is considered more suitable with increasing distance to armoring. NOAAs Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) contains mapped extent of shoreline armoring and is used to assess presence or absence consistently across the region. A suitability index is then assessed as follows: \\[shoreline = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.01*dist_{armor} &amp; dist_{armor}=0-100m\\\\ 1.0 &amp; dist_{armor}&gt;100m \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(shoreline\\) is a suitability index relative to shoreline armoring and \\(dist_{armor}\\) is the distance to the nearest armored shoreline in meters. 4.5.5 Potential extension of marine, intertidal models The marine, intertidal model represents trade-offs between habitat needs for multiple taxa and availability of data at regional scales. Future model development could be expanded to include more processes and outcome, specifically: A vegetative cover metric may be appropriate for some ecological processes such as the role of this system as a corridor. However, different habitat needs presented a challenge for scoping this metric, and some authors have distinguished the difference in the upper, vegetated intertidal zone and the lower, unvegetated areas (USACE 2009). Substrate is a key driver of beach outcomes in many contexts (Lodder et al. 2021), and specifically, substrate is often included in regional models of this system (e.g., Brady and Schrading (1996), Avissar (2006)). However, high quality substrate data were unavailable, which created a major data gap for incorporating this variable. Other assessment procedures (Farmer et al. (2000), USACE (2009)) have included a variety of human development pressures related to local features (e.g., vehicle and foot traffic), which could provide important refinement of the human use intensity metrics for land use and shoreline development. Wave environments clearly affect the morphology of beaches, and additional hydrodynamic variables could be assessed in future models. 4.6 Marine, Subtidal Zone Marine, subtidal ecosystems include the areas of high salinity (&gt; 28 psu) bracketed by tidal limits of the mean lower low water (MLLW) and 2m below Mean Tide Level (MTL). In the context of NYBEM, these systems tend to directly front the Atlantic Ocean or occur in high salinity zones near inlets. Figure 4.12 presents a conceptual model of the marine, subtidal ecosystem. This nearshore ecosystem hosts a variety of species of management interest such as hard clams, winter flounder, and seagrasses. As such, this model generally centers on the pelagic systems, submerged aquatic vegetation, and the benthic system. In general, coastal storm risk management actions are more likely to have direct effects on this ecosystem (e.g., footprint of constructed storm surge barriers) than indirect, offsite concerns more common in the estuarine systems. Figure 4.12: Conceptual model for the marine, subtidal submodel. The tension between human uses of this landscape and ecological outcomes has long been acknowledged, and many models have been developed to assess ecological outcomes in marine, subtidal zones of the region. This submodel drew heavily from three primary bodies of knowledge, specifically: NY/NJ harbor mitigation functional assessment models (USACE 2000) Habitat suitability models for winter flounder (Banner and Schaller 2001) and hard clam (Mulholland 1984). Regional monitoring data associated with NY/NJ Harbor Deepening (USACE (2012), USACE (n.d.a), USACE (n.d.b)), essential fish habitat mapping (USACE 2013), and water quality data for the lower bay (DEP 2018, USACE (n.d.b)). Four main classes of processes and dynamics were identified from a review of these models and studies: (1) substrate-driven habitat use, (2) physical currents and mixing, (3) light penetration, and (4) human uses of the system. For each process, surrogate metrics were identified, which collectively reflect the condition of the marine, subtidal zone. The sections below describe each metric and the rationale in detail, but briefly: Current velocity is a major driver of sediment dynamics as well as water quality processes. Fine substrate affects utilization of habitats by a variety of taxa. Light penetration is a proxy for both water quality outcomes and potential SAV growth. Vessel traffic density is a proxy for human use intensity. The overall habitat suitability of the marine, subtidal zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these four metrics. \\(I_{mar.sub} = \\frac{velocity + substrate + light + vessel.density}{4}\\) Where \\(I_{mar.sub}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the marine subtidal zone, \\(velocity\\) is a suitability index relative to beach slope, \\(substrate\\) is a suitability index relative to fine substrate, \\(light\\) is a suitability index relative to light penetration, and \\(vessel.density\\) is a suitability index relative to boat traffic and human uses. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.13: Suitability index curves for the marine, deepwater zone. 4.6.1 Velocity Velocity, currents, and wave environment are a key determinant of habitat suitability as well as critical drivers of sediment dynamics and water quality processes. For example, hard clam habitat suitability is generally in low to moderate velocity environments (&lt;50 cm/s) with declines in suitability up to 100 cm/s. For NYBEM, the velocity suitability for hard clams is adopted directly from Mulholland (1984) as shown below. We assess velocity as the median velocity observed over an annual hydrodynamic simulation. \\[velocity = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.016*V_{50}+0.6 &amp; V_{50}=0-1\\\\ 1.0 &amp; V_{50}=1-10\\\\ -0.02*ves_{AIS}+2 &amp; V_{50}=10-100\\\\ 0.0 &amp; V_{50}&gt;100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(velocity\\) is a suitability index relative to currents and velocity and \\(ves_{AIS}\\) is the vessel density from the Automated Information System. 4.6.2 Substrate Sediment quality drives multiple aspects of ecosystem integrity such as benthic habitat provision, nutrient dynamics, and erodibility. Fine sediment composition (i.e., %fine) is a common metric in multiple assessment procedures in the region (e.g., Mulholland (1984), USACE (2000), USACE (2021)). Specifically, the suitability curve from the hard clam model (Mulholland 1984) is used as the basis for this rapid metric of ecosystem quality. Notably, the curve was modified such that the suitability index is 0.1 when fines are 100%; this change was made in response to more recent literature showing the value of fine sediment patches as part of a habitat mosaic (Kritzer et al.Â 2016). For marine environments, sediment data are obtained from the usSEABED data set throughout the region. Habitat suitability is then quantified as follows: \\[substrate = -0.009*fines_{per}+1\\] Where \\(substrate\\) is a suitability index relative to sediment substrate and \\(fines_{per}\\) is the proportion of fine sediment (silt and clay) at the location. 4.6.3 Light Light penetration provides an important metric of general water quality as well as suitability for submerged aquatic vegetation. Specifically, light availability drives photosynthesis in SAV. Light attenuates within the water column based on depth and water clarity (i.e., the deeper and more turbid the water, the less light reaches the bottom). For the marine subtidal submodel, light availability and suitability are modeled following the same algorithms described for the estuarine subtidal model (See Section 4.4.2.1), which can be summarized in suitability terms as as: \\[light = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; PLA&lt;10\\\\ 0.0833*PLA-0.83 &amp; PLA&gt;70\\\\ 1.0 &amp; PLA&gt;22\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(light\\) is a suitability index relative to light penetration and \\(PLA\\) is percent light available (PLA). 4.6.4 Vessel Density Human-mediated disturbances (e.g., urban development, increased vessel traffic, etc.) can negatively impact SAV abundance. We quantify these disturbances through a proxy of vessel traffic per year. Vessel traffic is obtained from the Automatic Identification System database. Lower traffic (less than 1,000 tracks per year) is considered optimal and the suitability decreases with increasing vessel traffic. Suitability scores for are quantified as follows: \\[vessel.density = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; ves_{AIS}=0-1000\\\\ -0.0001*ves_{AIS}+1.1 &amp; ves_{AIS}=1000-10000\\\\ 0.1 &amp; ves_{AIS}&gt;10000 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(vessel.density\\) is a suitability index relative to ship traffic and \\(ves_{AIS}\\) is the annual vessel tracks over a patch from the Automated Information System. 4.6.5 Potential extension of marine, subtidal model NYBEMs marine subtidal submodel provides a simple framework for estimating general ecosystem condition, which was centered on indicator species of hard clam and seagrasses. Other indicator taxa, variables, and processes should be addressed in future iterations where possible. Specifically, substrate is a dynamic feature through time, particularly with sea level change, and substrate could be linked to sediment transport algorithms in coastal dynamics models. Similarly, wave environment is an important feature of this ecosystem, and additional wave metrics could be incorporated. In the present iteration of NYBEM, light attenuation is assumed to be dependent on a single light coefficient (\\(K_{d}\\)). However, light attenuation can vary significantly based on suspended sediment concentration, algal processes, or water color, all of which may vary in time. Future version of the model could also consider spatially distributed data sets of light coefficients such as those by NOAA. 4.7 Marine, Deepwater Zone The marine, deepwater ecosystem considers areas with salinity values greater or equal to 28 psu and depths from 2 to 20 m. Physical, biological and chemical variables may be compounded by anthropogenic and climatic pressures to influence the overall integrity of this system. Figure 4.14 presents a conceptual model of the marine, deepwater ecosystem, which is strongly dominated by large-scale oceanographic processes and less so by potential coastal storm risk management features. Ecologically, this ecosystem hosts a variety of species of management interest such as mammals, turtles, surf clams, migratory fish, and flounder (winter). Figure 4.14: Conceptual model for the marine, deepwater submodel. The following variables are used to assess the marine deepwater submodel: (1) salinity, (2) velocity and currents, (3) light attenuation, and (4)) vessel traffic. Salinity acts as a proxy for vertical mixing of the water column and influence of freshwater inputs (Smit et al. 2021). Current velocities represent mixing and flushing of the system, sediment suspension, and benthic scouring. Light penetration depths within the water column indicate water column turbidity, nutrient loading and algal production levels. Finally, vessel traffic provides an index for development pressures for both commercial and recreational fishing pressure on the pelagic, demersal and benthic systems and commercial and recreational vessel density pressures on the marine mammal populations within the area (population stress from ship strikes and noise). The overall habitat suitability of the marine, deepwater zone may then be aggregated into a single metric via an arithmetic mean of suitability indices for these four metrics. \\(I_{mar.deep} = \\frac{salinity.low.dur + velocity.low.change + light + vessel.density}{4}\\) Where \\(I_{mar.deep}\\) is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the marine intertidal zone, \\(salinity.low.dur\\) is a suitability index relative to low salinity periods, \\(velocity.low.change\\) is a suitability index relative to changes in low velocity, \\(light\\) is a suitability index relative to light penetration through water, and \\(vessel.density\\) is a suitability index relative to ship traffic. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. Figure 4.15: Suitability index curves for the marine, deepwater zone. 4.7.1 Salinity Salinity, often used as a proxy for the total concentration of all dissolved salts in the water, is a key factor in water density that controls the vertical mixing of nutrients and chemicals throughout the water column. Salinity constrains dissolved oxygen concentration and limits speciation of marine zones to euryhaline taxa that are physiological adapted to tolerate hypoosmotic processes (are able to maintain a lower internal ionic concentration than seawater). For NYBEM, the salinity regime is summarized through a metric of the percent of time salinity is less than the marine ecosystem threshold of 30 psu. This approach assumes that freshwater inputs serve as disturbance on the ecosystem, and higher marine levels of salinity are preferred. Depth-averaged salinity is computed or measured at small time steps over an annual or inter-annual timeframe. These data may then be summarized as an exceedence curve with thresholds from 0-100% in 10% intervals. For NYBEM, this exceedence curve is used to calculate the percent of time salinity is less than or equal to 30 psu. This duration metric is then translated into a suitability metric as follows: \\[salinity.low.dur = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.02*sal_{dur}+1 &amp; sal_{dur}=0-50\\\\ 0.0 &amp; sal_{dur}=50-100 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(salinity.low.dur\\) is a suitability index relative to low salinity periods and \\(sal_{dur}\\) is the percent of time salinity is less than the threshold for marine habitat (i.e., salinity &lt; 30 psu). 4.7.2 Current Velocity The marine deepwater environment is subjected to velocity effects from ocean currents and tides that affect vertical and horizontal mixing and flushing of the system, suspended sediment and solids, substrate settlement of taxa, as well as the operation of small and recreational vessels. Low flow conditions allow for the settlement of sediment, possibly burying viable habitat, reducing mixing and flushing, and potentially facilitating hypoxic conditions. Conversely, high velocities scour the benthic environment, prohibiting settling in the substrate by benthic taxa. Low flow conditions are particularly of concern for these processes, so a representative low velocity (i.e., 10% exceedance probability) is used within NYBEM as a key indicator metric. Suitability is then calculated based on the change in this low velocity relative to a baseline condition. For NYBEM, the baseline condition is assessed as the existing condition for a representative tidal year. Suitability declines linearly beyond a 10% change in this metric from the baseline with sharper decreases as velocities slow. \\[velocity.low.change = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.011*vel_{rel}+1.11 &amp; vel_{rel}=-100-10\\\\ 1.0 &amp; vel_{rel}=-10-10\\\\ -0.0022*vel_{rel}+1.02 &amp; vel_{rel}&gt;10 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(velocity.low.change\\) is a suitability index relative to change in low velocity and mixing and \\(vel_{rel}\\) is the relative change in low velocity from a baseline condition assessed as: \\(vel_{rel}=\\frac{vel_{10,f}-vel_{10,b}}{vel_{10,b}}\\). Where \\(vel_{10,f}\\) is the 10% exceedence velocity for a focal condition and \\(vel_{10,b}\\) is a 10% exceedence velocity for a baseline condition. 4.7.3 Light The depth that light reaches within the water column acts as a proxy for the viability of water column turbidity, nutrient loading, and chlorophyll-a production (an essential building block for ocean productivity). As light controls chlorophyll-a production, it may be seen as a limiting factor for algal and particulate organic matter densities, and ultimately the development of harmful algal blooms. Therefore, light provides a meaningful metric for a variety of biological processes in this ecosystem. For the marine deepwater submodel, light availability and suitability are modeled following the same algorithms described for the estuarine subtidal model (See Section 4.4.2.1), which can be summarized in suitability terms as as: \\[light = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.0 &amp; PLA&lt;10\\\\ 0.0833*PLA-0.83 &amp; PLA&gt;70\\\\ 1.0 &amp; PLA&gt;22\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(light\\) is a suitability index relative to light penetration and \\(PLA\\) is percent light available (PLA). 4.7.4 Vessel Traffic Vessel traffic density provides an index for development pressures, both commercial and recreational fishing pressure, and commercial and recreational vessel density pressures on the marine mammal populations within the area (population stress from ship strikes and noise pollution). We quantify these disturbances through a proxy of vessel traffic per year. These data also indicate frequently visited fishing locations and offshore structures. Vessel traffic is obtained from the Automatic Identification System database. Lower traffic (less than 1,000 tracks per year) is considered optimal and the suitability decreases with increasing vessel traffic. Suitability scores for are quantified as follows: \\[vessel.density = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 &amp; ves_{AIS}=0-1000\\\\ -0.0001*ves_{AIS}+1.1 &amp; ves_{AIS}=1000-10000\\\\ 0.1 &amp; ves_{AIS}&gt;10000 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Where \\(vessel.density\\) is a suitability index relative to ship traffic and \\(ves_{AIS}\\) is the annual vessel tracks over a patch from the Automated Information System. 4.7.5 Potential extension of marine, deepwater model The marine deepwater zone is affected by many processes not included in NYBEM. Future model development could explore the following: Dissolved oxygen concentration, a key element for the survival of marine species, limits speciation of marine zones through hypoxia, where low oxygen levels may cause die-offs in marine species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations act as a proxy for pelagic, demersal and benthic fauna biomass (abundance/diversity of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, marine turtles, birds and mammals). Data could potentially be integrated from sources such as permanent monitoring stations, as supported by NYC DEP Monitoring Stations (2018), Jamaica Bay Eutrophication Model (Fischbach et al. 2018), frameworks such as the Chesapeake Bay model (Cerco and Cole 1993), and the EPA Long Island Sound integrated model (underway). Water temperature acts as a control for the majority of the chemical (dissolved nutrients, pH, density, and photosynthesis), biological (respiration and metabolic rates, taxa development, and migrations) and physical (ice formation and thermal stratification of the water column) properties of a marine ecosystem. Methods could be adapted from the Winter flounder habitat suitability model (Banner and Schaller 2001), VIMS 2018 habitat suitability models, or the USACE Harbor monitoring (USACE 2013), and data could potentially be extracted from MARACOOS Monthly Sea Surface Temperature via the MARCO Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal or via hydrodynamic model outputs. The wave environment affects many variables with the New York Bight: vertical and horizontal mixing and flushing of the physical and chemical properties of the water, suspended sediment and solids, substrate settlement of taxa, and commercial and recreational vessel traffic. Wave height and wave refraction could be assessed from analytical software such as STWAVE (Byrnes et al. (2004)). In the present iteration of NYBEM, light attenuation is assumed to be dependent on a single light coefficient (\\(K_{d}\\)). However, light attentuation can vary significantly based on suspended sediment concentration, algal processes, or water color, all of which may vary in time. Future version of the model could also consider spatially distributed data sets of light coefficients such as those by NOAA. 4.8 nybem R-package Rapid timelines and iterative development encourage a transparent approach for model development and documentation. We adopt a growing family of methods for reproducible research, which embrace transparent coding techniques and data sharing. Specifically, R Markdown is applied to develop and document models, which are coded in the R Statistical Software. Similarly, all model code is contained within a transportable R-package (i.e., nybem) following common development procedures. All model code for the nybem R-package is available via github. Generally speaking, a package can be thought of as a fundamental unit of code that can include functions, data, documentation, and tests (Wickham and Bryan 2019). Packages then provide a transportable and reproducible mechanism for code sharing and publication. The nybem package contains two sets of functions and one data object storing suitability curves (Figure 4.1). The first set of functions can largely be thought of as habitat mapping functions, which delineate NYBEM habitat zones. The second set of functions compute habitat quality using a general set of algorithms and data management functions. The data object contains suitability curve data as described in Sections 4.2-4.7. These topics will be treated separately in 4.8.1-4.8.3, respectively. Model code may be inspected on the nybem github repo, and in-line documentation further describes the logic of the model. Notably, all functions and data presented in nybem are modular and can be used independently. For instance, ecosystems could be delineated from empirical data (e.g., field or tide gauge data) or modeled hydrodynamic data. Similarly, habitat quality assessments could be conducted for one of the six habitat types without consideration of the others. 4.8.1 Habitat Mapping Functions The first set of functions in nybem collectively allow for delineation and mapping of the six major ecosystem types described in Sections 3.2. Three functions execute the logic of habitat delineation shown in Section 4.1. set_tidal_zone delineates four types of tidal regimes: deepwater, subtidal, intertidal, and upland (coded as outputs of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Inputs to this function are bed elevation, mean lower low water (MLLW), and mean higher high water (MHHW). Here is the relevant portion of the function: set_tidal_zone &lt;- function(bedelev, MLLW, MHHW){ # ... # Assign tidal zone values tidal_zone &lt;- nybem::ifelse(bed_elevation &lt;= -2, 1, # Deep nybem::ifelse(bed_elevation &lt;= MLLW, 2, # Subtidal nybem::ifelse(bed_elevation &lt;= MHHW, 3, # Intertidal nybem::ifelse(bed_elevation &gt; MHHW, 4, 0)))) # Upland ## ... return(tidal_zone) } set_salinity_zone delineates three salinity regimes: marine, estuarine, and freshwater (coded as outputs of 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Inputs to this function are a representative low salinity. Here is the relevant portion of the function: set_salinity_zone &lt;- function(salinity){ # ... #Assign salinity zone salinity_zone &lt;- ifelse(salinity &gt;= estuarine_marine_break, 1, # Marine ifelse(salinity &lt; estuarine_marine_break &amp; salinity &gt;= fresh_estuarine_break, 2, # Estuarine ifelse(salinity &lt; fresh_estuarine_break, 3, 0))) # Fresh # ... return(salinity_zone) } set_habitat_zone combines tidal and salinity zonation into seven major ecosystem types: upland, marine deepwater, marine subtidal, marine intertidal, estuarine subtidal, estuarine intertidal, and freshwater tidal (coded as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively). Notably, upland ecosystems are outside of the model domain and do not include habitat suitability models below. Here is the relevant portion of the function: set_habitat_zone &lt;- function(tidal_zone, salinity_zone){ # ... #Assign habitat zone habitat_zone &lt;- ifelse(tidal_zone == 4, 1, ifelse(salinity_zone == 1 &amp; tidal_zone == 1, 2, ifelse(salinity_zone == 1 &amp; tidal_zone == 2, 3, ifelse(salinity_zone == 1 &amp; tidal_zone == 3, 4, ifelse(salinity_zone == 2 &amp; (tidal_zone == 1 | tidal_zone == 2), 5, ifelse(salinity_zone == 2 &amp; tidal_zone == 3, 6, ifelse(salinity_zone == 3 &amp; (tidal_zone == 1 | tidal_zone == 2 | tidal_zone == 3), 7, 0))))))) # ... return(habitat_zone) } 4.8.2 Habitat Quality Functions This group of functions computes habitat quality and can be thought of as the major computational engine of nybem. Two functions in particular conduct the bulk of habitat suitability calculations. SIcalc computes suitability for a given set of suitability curves (Section 4.8.3) and a set of user-defined inputs. HSIcalc computes an overarching habitat suitability index from multiple suitability indices (i.e., the output of SIcalc). These functions are adapted from an existing R-package for single patch habitat suitability analyses, ecorest (McKay and Hernandez-Abrams 2020). The prior model did not contain raster functionality for spatially explicit mapping, and the functions were adapted to handle this different data format. SIcalc computes habitat suitability relative to multiple variables and user-defined inputs. For instance, NYBEMs freshwater tidal submodel include suitability curves associated with salinity, vegetation cover, and episodic flooding and sediment deposition (Section 4.2). SIcalc takes in the breakpoints of these suitability curves along with user-defined inputs for a given site and scenario. Suitability index curves may be specified as either categorical or continuous variables. For categorical variables, the model uses a look-up approach to identify suitability associated with that class. For continuous variables, the model computes suitability by linearly interpolating suitability values associated with the user inputs. Additional detail may be found in the ecorest reference manual. SIcalc &lt;- function (SI, input_proj) { # Set number of metrics in the SI model (count of breakpoint-SI pairs) nSI &lt;- length(colnames(SI))/2 # input_proj parameter must be list to preserve metric data type if(!is.list(input_proj)) {stop(&quot;input_proj must be a list&quot;)} # Number of inputs must match number of model metrics if(length(input_proj) != nSI) { stop(&quot;Number of inputs does not equal required SI model metrics&quot;)} # Iterate through each pair of model metric and inputs SI_out &lt;- list() for(i in 1:nSI) { # Set current model values current_metric_column &lt;- 2 * i - 1 current_si_column &lt;- 2 * i metric_vector &lt;- SI[, current_metric_column] si_vector &lt;- SI[, current_si_column] current_metric_continuous &lt;- is.numeric(metric_vector) # Set current input_proj values current_input_raster &lt;- nybem::is_RasterLayer(input_proj[[i]]) if(current_input_raster) { current_input &lt;- raster::getValues(input_proj[[i]]) } else { current_input &lt;- input_proj[[i]] } # Check if current metric and input are of the same data type current_input_continuous &lt;- all( is.numeric(current_input), if(current_input_raster) {!input_proj[[i]]@data@isfactor}) if(current_input_continuous != current_metric_continuous) { stop(&quot;Input data types must match data types of SI model metrics&quot;)} # Calculate continuous SI if(current_metric_continuous == TRUE) { si &lt;- approx(metric_vector, si_vector, xout = current_input, method = &quot;linear&quot;, rule = 2, ties = &quot;ordered&quot;)$y } # Calculate categorical SI if(current_metric_continuous != TRUE) { # Create named vector for lookup get_cat_metric &lt;- si_vector names(get_cat_metric) &lt;- metric_vector # Get si values for current_input si &lt;- unname(get_cat_metric[current_input]) } # Assign si to SI_out[[i]] if(current_input_raster) { SI_out[[i]] &lt;- raster::setValues(input_proj[[i]], si) } else { SI_out[[i]] &lt;- si } } return(SI_out) } HSIcalc takes in suitability indices associated with multiple variables and computes and overarching habitat suitability index, which can be thought of as a metric of ecosystem condition or integrity. The model computes suitability based on an arithmetic mean although other forms of combination (e.g., geometric mean, minimums) could be incorporated into future versions. HSIcalc &lt;- function(si_list, method = &quot;mean&quot;) { # si_list parameter must be list to preserve metric data type if(!is.list(si_list)) {stop(&quot;si_list must be a list&quot;)} if(!(method %in% c(&quot;mean&quot;))) { stop(&quot;method must be one of &#39;mean&#39;, &quot;)} # Check input for rasters raster_input &lt;- any(unlist(lapply(si_list, is_RasterLayer))) # Create a raster brick if(raster_input) { si &lt;- raster::brick(si_list) } # Convert list to vector for non-rasters if(!raster_input) { si &lt;- unlist(si_list) } if(method == &quot;mean&quot;) { if(!raster_input) { hsi_score &lt;- mean(si, na.rm = TRUE) } if(raster_input) { hsi_score &lt;- raster::calc(si, mean) } } return(hsi_score) } A variety of small scale utility functions were also needed to manage input / output data and support these functions. The underlying code for these functions can be found in the nybem package and help documentation, but it is not presented here in the interest of brevity. In general, the utility functions have the following goals. is_RasterLayer verifies that the input to a given function is of class raster::RasterLayer. is_cat_raster verifies that the input to a given function is of class raster::RasterLayer and is a factor. ifelse provides capacity to execute if-else logic statements on raster data. write_cat_tiff writes a categorical raster that preserves color schemes in the raster attribute table for ESRI reverse compatibility. write_cont_tiff writes a continuous raster that preserves color schemes in the raster attribute table for ESRI reverse compatibility. raster_fig creates a raster figure cropped to the specified extent. na_outside_model sets all HSI values outside of the modeled habitat zone to -1 to distinguish areas inside the study area, but outside the modeled habitat zone. name_model assigns a name to a raster HSI model. Used for processing individual models into alternatives analysis for a study area. model_summary displays a brief set of result summaries for each HSI model. summarize_by_poly summarizes the raster HSI model by polygon. are_colors determines if the input is a vector of valid colors according to the grDevices::col2rgb function. has_colortable determines if a RasterLayer has a valid colortable defined. 4.8.3 Habitat Suitability Curves The final major component of the nybem package is a single data object that stores all of the habitat suitability curves. This object is a list format with each list element holding the set of suitability curves associated with one submodel (e.g., freshwater tidal). The following code displays this list for comparison against suitability curves presented in Sections 4.2-4.7. #Store models in a single list nybem.submodels &lt;- list(NYBEM.fresh.tid, NYBEM.est.int, NYBEM.est.sub.hard, NYBEM.est.sub.soft.sav, NYBEM.est.sub.soft.clam, NYBEM.mar.int, NYBEM.mar.sub, NYBEM.mar.deep) names(nybem.submodels) &lt;- c(&quot;fre.tid&quot;, &quot;est.int&quot;, &quot;est.sub.hard&quot;, &quot;est.sub.soft.sav&quot;, &quot;est.sub.soft.clam&quot;, &quot;mar.int&quot;, &quot;mar.sub&quot;, &quot;mar.deep&quot;) #Show model data nybem.submodels ## $fre.tid ## salinity.per salinity.SIV veg.cover.per veg.cover.SIV deposition ## 1 0 1 0 0.1 1 ## 2 20 0 57 0.5 2 ## 3 100 0 100 1.0 5 ## 4 NA NA NA NA NA ## deposition.SIV ## 1 0 ## 2 1 ## 3 1 ## 4 NA ## ## $est.int ## erosion erosion.SIV veg.cover.per veg.cover.SIV deposition deposition.SIV ## 1 -50 1 0 0.1 0 1 ## 2 10 1 100 1.0 1 0 ## 3 50 0 NA NA NA NA ## land.use.per land.use.SIV shoreline.m shoreline.SIV ## 1 0 1 0 0.5 ## 2 10 1 100 1.0 ## 3 100 0 500 1.0 ## ## $est.sub.hard ## cultch cultch.SIV MAS MAS.SIV AS AS.SIV ## 1 0 0 0 0.00 0 0.00 ## 2 100 1 2 0.00 5 0.00 ## 3 NA NA 4 0.05 10 1.00 ## 4 NA NA 6 0.50 15 1.00 ## 5 NA NA 8 1.00 20 0.60 ## 6 NA NA 40 1.00 25 0.25 ## 7 NA NA NA NA 30 0.10 ## 8 NA NA NA NA 40 0.00 ## 9 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## ## $est.sub.soft.sav ## substrate.sav substrate.sav.SIV light.PLA light.SIV vessel.density ## 1 0 1.0 0 0 0 ## 2 70 1.0 10 0 1000 ## 3 100 0.1 22 1 10000 ## 4 NA NA 100 1 NA ## vessel.density.SIV ## 1 1.0 ## 2 1.0 ## 3 0.1 ## 4 NA ## ## $est.sub.soft.clam ## salinity.clam salinity.clam.SIV substrate.clam.fines substrate.clam.SIV Isav ## 1 0.0 0.00 0 1.00 0.0 ## 2 12.0 0.00 50 0.75 0.2 ## 3 12.5 0.25 90 0.25 0.8 ## 4 20.0 0.75 100 0.00 1.0 ## 5 25.0 1.00 NA NA NA ## 6 35.0 1.00 NA NA NA ## 7 45.0 0.00 NA NA NA ## Isav.SIV ## 1 1 ## 2 1 ## 3 0 ## 4 0 ## 5 NA ## 6 NA ## 7 NA ## ## $mar.int ## beach.slope.per beach.slope.SIV trel exp.dur.SIV land.use.per land.use.SIV ## 1 0 1 0.00 0 0 1 ## 2 10 1 0.25 1 10 1 ## 3 30 0 0.75 1 100 0 ## 4 NA NA 1.00 0 NA NA ## shoreline.m shoreline.SIV ## 1 0 0 ## 2 100 1 ## 3 500 1 ## 4 NA NA ## ## $mar.sub ## velocity velocity.SIV substrate.fines substrate.SIV light.PLW light.SIV ## 1 0 0.6 0 1.0 0 0 ## 2 25 1.0 100 0.1 10 0 ## 3 50 1.0 NA NA 22 1 ## 4 100 0.0 NA NA 100 1 ## vessel.density vessel.density.SIV ## 1 0 1.0 ## 2 1000 1.0 ## 3 10000 0.1 ## 4 NA NA ## ## $mar.deep ## salinity.low.dur salinity.low.SIV velocity.low.change velocity.low.SIV ## 1 0 1 -100 0.0 ## 2 50 0 -10 1.0 ## 3 100 0 10 1.0 ## 4 NA NA 100 0.8 ## light.PLW light.SIV vessel.density vessel.density.SIV ## 1 0 0 0 1.0 ## 2 10 0 1000 1.0 ## 3 22 1 10000 0.1 ## 4 100 1 NA NA "],["evaluation.html", "Chapter 5 Evaluation 5.1 System Quality 5.2 Technical Quality 5.3 Usability", " Chapter 5 Evaluation Like many ecological models, NYBEM relies on multiple variables and ecological processes, and unsurprisingly, the complexity of the model escalated to include many components, inputs, assumptions, and modules. Model evaluation is the overaching process for ensuring that numerical tools are scientifically defensible and transparently developed. Evaluation is often referred to as verification or validation, but it in fact includes a family of methods ranging from peer review to model testing to error checking (Schmolke et al. 2010). In this more general sense, evaluation should include the following (Grant and Swannack 2008): (1) assessing the reasonableness of model structure, (2) assessing functional relationships and verifying code, (3) evaluating model behavior relative to expected patterns, (4) comparing outcomes to empirical data, if possible, and (5) analyzing uncertainty in predictions. The USACE has established an ecological model certification process to ensure that planning models are sound and functional. This review process evaluates tools relative to three categories: system quality, technical quality, and usability (EC 1105-2-412). 5.1 System Quality Ecological models must not only maintain an appropriate theoretical and technical basis, but also must be computationally accurate (McKay et al.Â 2022b). System quality refers to the computational integrity of a model (or modeling system). For instance, is the tool appropriately programmed, has it been verified or stress-tested, and do outcomes behave in expected ways? System quality has three primary phases for avoiding errors (quality assurance), detecting errors through formal testing (quality control), and updating models based on review and use (model update) (McKay et al.Â 2022b), and NYBEM was evaluated relative to each. Quality assurance procedures were central to the NYBEM development process. First, models were version controlled via github. Second, model documentation was developed in parallel to code and also version controlled via github. Third, models were developed modularly, which facilitated separate testing and independent applications. Fourth, the computational engine of all six ecosystem-specific models flowed through two central functions (SIcalc and HSIcalc), which reduced versioning issues. Finally, these two main functions were adapted from a prior habitat modeling package, ecorest. Additionally, quality control procedures were applied to find and correct any errors. Model coding was primarily done by one team member (MPD) and then quality controlled by another (SKM), both of whom have over 10-years experience with R-programming. All functions in the nybem package were also formally tested during every build of the model following industry best practice using the R package testthat. Testing frameworks like testthat allow a battery of custom tests to be created and run regularly as development proceeds to validate behavior as new capabilities are added and modified. Each function was tested with known extreme values (e.g., suitability index = 0) and other pertinent tests. Tests are recorded within a dedicated folder within the package itself for ease of access and long-term archival. This battery of tests were run iteratively during the development of each function using the devtools::test function. R packages should also be subjected to regular diagnostic checks using the definitive R CMD check function provided as a part of R. This large battery of tests verifies that the structure of your package is correct and is ready to be distributed and used by other users. Documentation is a standard component of R packages to ensure that all components are clearly described for users. All model functions were documented using the strict requirements for R packaging. Vignettes (R user guides) were included to help users get started with using the model. A website of the package documentation was created using pkgdown. Model errors are often uncovered during peer review and/or applications (i.e., bugs), which can be particularly important for large-scale or complex models. The model and associated report were reviewed through USACE certification procedures, and review comments are archived here for future reference (Appendix B). The report and package will both remain available and updated through github, and any additional bugs will be amended through this long-term model update and archival process. 5.2 Technical Quality The technical quality of a model is assessed relative to its reliance on contemporary theory, consistency with design objectives, and degree of verification and validation against independent field data. To date, NYBEMs technical quality has revolved around three main techniques: reliance on standard methods, adaptation of existing models, and informal model review by technical stakeholders. The overarching approach for the NYBEM uses a habitat-style, quantity-quality assessment framework. This index-based model type has been applied extensively to assess outcomes ranging from the species to ecosystem levels of hierarchy (e.g., habitat evaluation procedures and the hydrogeomorphic methods, respectively). The framework is common within the management context of the USACE and familiar to decision-makers, reviewers, and partner agencies. The NYBEM has also drawn heavily from existing analytical models for coastal ecosystems in the region. Suitability curves were directly adopted or adapted from existing peer-reviewed models whenever possible. For instance, the marine intertidal model alone adopted suitability curves, variables, or methods from (Farmer et al. 2000), (USACE 2009), (Avissar 2006), (Nancy Jackson, Karl Nordstorm, and David R. Smith 2010), (Lathrope et al. 2013), (Brady and Schrading 1996), (Sellars and Jolls 2007), (Dunkin et al. 2016), and others. When adaptation was not feasible, methods and suitability thresholds were sought in the peer-reviewed literature (e.g., light attenuation for seagrass from Short et al. (2002)). Transparent modeling methods and mediated modeling workshops also provide a source of technical quality for the NYBEM. A series of meetings were held with technical stakeholders representing diverse disciplines, agencies, and geographies (Appendix A). Each meeting provided attendees with opportunities to share resources, data, and ideas as well as steer the direction of model development in terms of recommending variables. Additional examinations of technical quality should be pursued systematically to further evaluate the NYBEM. Some key elements of evaluation that should be explored include: Habitat zones and quality should be compared to existing habitat maps for the region. For instance, the National Wetlands Inventory and analogous state data sets could provide important source of model verification data for the estuarine intertidal zone. Similarly, submerged aquatic vegetation and shellfish data sets may provide important tools for verification of estuarine subtidal models. Sensitivity analyses could be conducted to explore the relative importance of model variables and thresholds in suitability curves. Additional mediated modeling workshops could be pursued to continue obtaining input from regional experts. 5.3 Usability The usability of a model can influence the repeatable and transparent application of a tool. This type of evaluation typically examines the ease of use, availability of inputs, transparency, error potential, and education of the user. As such, defining the intended user(s) is a crucial component of assessing usability. The NYBEM was developed for application by the USACE technical team of the NJBB and HATS studies. The tool is not currently intended for broader application by local sponsors, other regional teams, or by other USACE Districts. As such, there is currently no graphical user interface for the model beyond the script itself. To date, the primary mechanism for maintaining usability is code sharing and use of reproducible research methods. R is a primary coding language for a substantial and growing proportion of research experts developing novel statistical algorithms. CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) makes it simple to learn from others work, share your own, and receive comments on possible changes. Packaging the NYBEM improves usability by providing a system for developing software that includes documentation and tests, resulting in higher software quality and development productivity. Similarly, this document was developed with Rmarkdown to facilitate model adaptation by others. Another simple, but important, aspect of NYBEMs usability is the flexibility of data inputs. The model can use hydrodynamic outcomes based on empirical or modeled data, and the major environmental inputs largely derive from regional and national data sets. Future enhancements to model usability could be pursued through means such as: Open data sharing of all site-specific inputs and outputs for interrogation by internal and external partners. Interactive data visualization platforms could provide an important mechanisms for reducing the barrier-to-entry on post-processing NYBEM data and increasing the utility of the tool for end-users. Mediated modeling workshops could be expanded to address usability by both gaging user needs but also providing informal training on model application. "],["application-and-communication.html", "Chapter 6 Application and Communication 6.1 NJBB Hydrodynamic Modeling 6.2 Environmental Data Compilation 6.3 Model Execution", " Chapter 6 Application and Communication The NYBEM has been explicitly designed to inform site screening and environmental impact assessment for the NJBB and HATS. A key component of this process is understanding the existing condition. This section presents a preliminary application of the NYBEM to assess ecosystem condition in the New Jersey Back Bays following three main activities: (1) Collection of hydrodynamic model outcomes, (2) Compilation of other environmental input data sets, and (3) Execution of the models. The objective of this chapter is to demonstrate the type of outcomes possible with the NYBEM, not to provide a comprehensive application to either project. 6.1 NJBB Hydrodynamic Modeling NYBEM is capable of reading in hydrodynamic conditions from empirical or modeled data sources. However, hydrodynamic models provide the primary basis for USACE planning because of their capacity to forecast outcomes over long time horizons with and without project actions. Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) is the numerical model code applied for hydrodynamic simulations in this study of the New Jersey Back Bays. For this study, the two-dimensional (2D) shallow water module of AdH is applied for all simulations. This code solves for depth-averaged velocity and salinity throughout the model domain. (More details of the 2D shallow water module of AdH and its computational philosophy and equations are available in Savant et al.Â 2014 and Savant and Berger 2015.) AdH version 4.6 was applied for this study. A 2D AdH model was developed and validated for simulation of hydrodynamics and salinity (Details provided in McAlpin and Ross, draft). The model was validated to available field data for all parameters. Field data were collected in February 2019 for salinity and discharge/velocity data over a 13-hour tidal cycle at three major inlets  Barnegat, Little Egg, and Great Egg. Field data supported the use of a 2D model as opposed to a three-dimensional (3D) model due to lack of major salinity stratification. The model domain was determined using aerial images and bathymetric/topographic data for the area. The Surface Water Modeling System was used to generate a 2D surface mesh and define material regions for applying specific model features, such as bed roughness. The domain is defined horizontally in Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 18 coordinates with units of meters. Vertically it is based on North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) with units of meters. All data applied to the model are shifted to this datum and coordinate system. Bathymetry data for the model were obtained from several sources: the Coastal Relief Model, sponsor collected hydrographic surveys, and the National Elevation Dataset. These data sets were combined such that the latest data were made a priority as well as data collected at finer resolution. The 2D AdH code can include areas that wet/dry; therefore, elevations were included in the domain up to 2 m NAVD88. The model domain includes over 9,867 square miles, extending approximately 115 miles along the New Jersey Atlantic Ocean coastline from Lewes, DE, to Manasquan, NJ. The 2D mesh contains 324,881 elements and 165,514 nodes. Figure 6.1 shows horizontal node resolution for the model with an example region surrounding the Barnegat Bay Inlet. Resolution is finest in the small wetland channels to accurately capture the conveyance of flow in these areas as well as the salinity that migrates upstream in deeper channels. Finer resolution is also seen in areas where geometric features need to be defined accurately, such as in the inlets and around jetties. Ten AdH simulations were executed: seven project alternatives and three projects rerun with sea level change. However, only the existing condition scenario is presented here. Figure 6.1: AdH node spacing as shown for a representative area of the NJBB study site around the Barnegat Bay Inlet. Color reflects bed elevation. AdH was executed for a base condition representing 2018 boundary conditions. For all simulations, the following variables were output: Bed elevation Water surface elevations: mean lower low water (MLLW), mean tide level (MTL), mean higher high water (MHHW), and 0 to 100% exceedence by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record) Salinity levels: mean annual and 0 to 100% exceedence by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record) Velocity: mean annual and 0 to 100% exceedence by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record) AdH outputs were interpolated from point data using a spline technique with barriers separating the marine and estuarine data points (i.e., salinity data were not interpolated over the barrier island) using ESRI Spatial Analyst Tools. The interpolated surfaces were then rasterized throughout the model domain. A 10m grid cell size was used as a balance between data resolution from the model outcomes, over- vs.Â under-parameterization, and application resolution (i.e., the relevant size of wetlands in the region). 6.2 Environmental Data Compilation Other environmental inputs are required for NYBEM beyond hydrodynamic inputs. Specifically, model inputs are needed for hard bottom substrates, substrate composition, vegetation cover, urban land use composition, shoreline armoring, and vessel traffic. The estuarine, subtidal model distinguishes hard bottom ecosystems from soft bottom ecosystems (e.g., oysters vs.Â SAV/clams, respectively). Hard bottom habitats are generally required for reef environments, and this cultch substrate is often a limiting factor in the region. These substrates tend to be less mobile and persist through time. As such, we use a map of historical oyster beds as a proxy for the presence or absence of hard bottom substrate. Shellfish maps from 1963 were digitized that show recreational, moderate commercial, and high commercial uses, all of which were merged into a single hard bottom data layer. Substrate composition is a major driving factor in both the estuarine and marine subtidal models. Although many nuanced methods exist for assessing substrate (e.g., grain size, distributional metrics, compaction, etc.), simple composition metrics such as percent sand or fine sediment (silt/clay) suffice for the purpose of NYBEM. Furthermore, other substrate metrics are not available at the scale of the NYBEM model domain. Two data sets were combined for this analysis. First, the usSEABED sampling points are available for much of the study area, but underrepresented in the back bay ecosystems. These data were augmented with additional substrate samples from Stockton University and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), which focused explicitly on the NJBB area. Sampling points from these two data sets were combined into a single point cloud and composition metrics were interpolated across the region. Vegetation cover provides an important and rapid measure of the plant communitys role in ecological function. Cover classes from the NLCD were used to assess this variable. This data set provides cover as a binary (presence / absence) metric at a 30m cell resolution for the entire Nation. A neighborhood analysis was used to translate this binary metric into a continuous variable. Specifically, a moving window assessment was applied with a 50m buffer distance from each raster cell in the NYBEM domain. Vegetation cover percentage was assessed as the mean cover of the cells within this area. The buffer distance of 50m was chosen as large enough to capture multiple cover measurements relative to the grid resolution but small enough to capture the general role of vegetation in the area. NLCD data were also used to assess the effects of urbanization on estuarine and marine intertidal systems. All urban land uses with the NLCD (codes 21, 22, 23, and 24) were reclassified as urban, and all other types were classified as non-urban. As was the case with vegetation cover, a moving window assessment was applied with a 100m buffer distance from each raster cell in the NYBEM domain. Neighboring urban land use was assessed as the mean cover of the cells within this area. The buffer distance of 100m was chosen to reflect the pervasive influence of urban processes (e.g., noise, light, and water quality) even at relatively large distances from a given patch. Shoreline armoring also provides an important metric of human use intensity in the intertidal models. The shoreline armoring data layer is a linear dataset developed by the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration. The layer represents linear areas of the coastal shoreline that are armored (i.e., solid man-made structures, riprap, boulder rubble) as of 2014 (NJ) and 2016 (NY). The Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) guidelines define these uses for the preparation, evaluation, and/or response to threats to the coastal environment such as oil spills. The shoreline was originally delineated at mean higher high water (MHHW) using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and high resolution digital orthophotography datasets. In subtidal and deepwater ecosystems, vessel density provides an important proxy for other human uses like fishing pressure, navigation, and resource extraction. An Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) vessel traffic density raster dataset was generated by the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and NOAA Office for Coastal Management from AIS Marine Cadastral data. This layer represents 2019 annual vessel transit counts of all vessels (i.e., commercial and recreational) summarized at a 100 m by 100 m pixel cell resolution. A single vessel transit is counted each time a vessel track passes through, starts, or stops within a 100 m grid cell. These data sets each represent trade-offs deemed acceptable for this application of the NYBEM. However, different applications could compell use of other data sources. For instance, the NYBEM spatial scale required heavy reliance on regional and national data sets. However, more local applications (e.g., a single bay) could have access to higher resolution data (e.g., locally mapped substrate or shoreline armoring). Data quality and resolution are a common challenge in large scale modeling, and future applications could consider alternative approaches. For this analysis, all data sets were rasterized at the 10m resolution and aligned based on the AdH hydrodynamic data. 6.3 Model Execution Bed elevation, water surface elevation (MHHW and MLLW), and salinity were input to the zonation functions (Sections 4.1 and 4.8.1) to identify tidal, salinity, and habitat zones. Figure 6.2 shows representative outputs from these functions for salinity and tidal zones as well as habitat types in the area surroudning Great Egg Inlet. Notably, these habitat zones represent only AdH outputs and do not necessarily reflect regulatory definitions of ecosystems. For instance, an area identified as an estuarine, subtidal ecosystem may (or may not) currently host submerged aquatic vegetation or hard-bottom reef environments, which would imply very different outcomes from a management perspective. Likewise, an estuarine, intertidal zone may currently be developed and non-functional from an ecological perspective. However, these outputs provide broad spatial coverage not feasible to collect for the entire study area. Figure 6.2: Demonstration of habitat zonation functions for delineating ecosystems based on tidal range, salinity, and the combined assessment for habitat types in the area surrounding the Great Egg Inlet Habitat quality may then be assessed for each ecosystem type as shown in Chapter 4. The SIcalc and HSIcalc functions (Section 4.8.2) are at the heart of all of the habitat quality calcuations. As such, it would be redundant to show multiple ecosystem applications for the purpose of demonstrating the NYBEM in this report. Here, we only present habitat quality for the estuarine intertidal ecosystem. The estuarine intertidal model (Section 4.3) assesses ecosystem integrity relative to five metrics: edge erosion, vegetative cover, episodic sediment deposition, development of adjacent uplands, and the presence/absence of shoreline armoring. Each of the input data sets described above was processed for use in these functions as described in Section 4.3. For instance, episodic sediment deposition relies on a metric calculated from multiple depth values based on AdH data. These inputs may then be translated into 0 to 1 suitability indices associated with each process (Figure 6.3). Figure 6.3: Example of suitability calculations for the estuarine intertidal model. The left panel show the percent of land use in urban uses, and the right panel shows the normalized (0 to 1) suitability outcome. The five suitability index values provide important insights into the limiting factors within a given area. For instance, the erosion metric provides no distinguishing effect across this domain because the metric is presented relative to a baseline condition of the existing condition (i.e., there is no percent change in this scenario). Conversely, the urban land use and shoreline armoring metrics behave as anticipated with greater effects near developed parts of the system and along roadways. Ultimately, these suitability data may also be aggregated into an overarching habitat suitability index for the area (Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Summary of the example application of the estuarine intertidal model in the Great Egg Inlet. As described at the beginning of Chapter 4, all NYBEM applications exist relative to three main elements: inputs, the model itself, and outputs. In this sample application, all of these elements have been briefly described. However, different applications may require varying types of post-processing. For instance, a table or summary statistics may be appropriate for rolling up impacts of different management actions at the bay scale, whereas an interactive map may be more appropriate for working with specific stakeholders on local concerns. Post-processing of outcomes is beyond the scope of the NYBEM code, but it represents an important element of effectively communicating an application of the NYBEM. "],["future-model-development.html", "Chapter 7 Future Model Development", " Chapter 7 Future Model Development This report has presented the development and application of the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM, nigh-bem). The models currently apply an index-based modeling framework (i.e., a habitat-suitability-style, quantity-quality approach) to assess patch-scale effects for six ecosystem types (e.g., estuarine intertidal zones). This report documents technical details, use, and relevant information for USACE model certification (EC 1105-2-412, PB 2013-02). In all applications, models represent incomplete abstractions of reality, and opportunities exist for future development of this toolkit. Specifically, the following items were identified as important topics for potential expansion: Improvements to Sub-Models: Six major habitat types were examined in the NYBEM, and important model extensions and knowledge gaps were noted as each model was presented (Sections 4.2-4.7). These habitat types could also be further divided into sub-types such as low marsh, high marsh, and tidal flats, and the model domain could be expanded to other habitat types (e.g., non-tidal freshwaters or riparian systems). Model Evaluation: Habitat zones and quality should be compared to existing habitat maps for the region. For instance, the National Wetlands Inventory and analogous state data sets could provide important source of model verification data for the estuarine intertidal zone. Similarly, submerged aquatic vegetation and shellfish data sets may provide important tools for verification of estuarine subtidal models. Appendix B has presented a preliminary version of these verification analyses, and additional analyses will be summarized in peer-reviewed journal articles (Mahan et al.Â forthcoming; Cordero et al.Â forthcoming). Furthermore, models could be compared with field-based approaches such as the Evaluation of Planned Wetlands (Bartoldus 1994), the New England Marsh Models (McKinney et al.Â 2009ab), or the Marsh Resilience to Sea-level rise model (Raposa et al.Â 2016). Spatial Scaling: The NYBEM is being applied in a spatially explicit format at a large regional scale. The spatial extent and grain of these analyses provide a unique opportunity to examine scaling issues and understand the effects of model assumptions (e.g., grid size) on observations about the system (e.g., overall habitat quality). Analyses are underway to understand these issues in the context of NYBEM (Saltus et al.Â forthcoming). System connectivity: As described in Chapter 3, NYBEM was conceived as a suite of models including habitat-type effects (presented here) as well as connectivity for migratory organisms. To date, connectivity models have not been developed to address impacts of storm surge barriers on migratory organisms. These models could draw from existing approaches in freshwater systems (e.g., McKay et al.Â 2017) as well as experiences in other estaurine systems with storm surge barriers (NOAA-Sponsored Workshop). Taxa-Specific Outcomes: NYBEM was designed as a tool for examining broad-scale effects of proposed coastal infrastructure on regional ecosystems. This model intends to provide a relative accounting of ecological outcomes at a regional scale with highly divergent management actions (e.g., Are the effects of Barrier-A 5% or 50% different than Barrier-B?). The model will be used to compare management alternatives to inform feasibility scale planning in the USACE and identify key regions where effects are anticipated. From these analyses, additional models may be required to examine imperiled species at a particular location. Effects of Barrier Closures: NYBEM is designed generally to respond to changes in hydrodynamics as a result of storm surge barriers. Clearly the operational patterns of these features would affect model outcomes (e.g., frequency or duration of gate closure). The strategy for model application would proceed through a series of increasingly detailed considerations of operations. First, a gates open scenario would be used to examine the effects of barrier structures on general hydrodynamic conditions, which would occur the majority of time. Second, a worst case scenario could be designed to study the effects of a complete closure on estuarine circulation and habitats. Third, more nuance closure scenarios could be studied using more representative closure frequencies, duration, and timing. As described in Chapter 1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is using the NYBEM in the context of two large-scale coastal storm risk management feasibility studies in the New York Bight ecosystem, specifically: the New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB) and the New York-New Jersey Harbor &amp; Tributaries Study (HATS). In these studies, the USACE is considering a diversity of measures for mitigating flood risks, including structural actions (e.g., levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers), non-structural measures (e.g., buy-outs, elevation of structures, flood-proofing), and natural and nature-based features (e.g., wetland creation, reefs for breakwaters). Environmental outcomes and acceptability are important constraints on plan selection, and the studies are applying a tiered approach to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The NYBEM was developed to partially inform the impact assessment process and is being used in conjunction with other information (e.g., contaminant mapping, cultural and historical resources, etc.) to inform decisions. The models intend to provide a broad general view of the effects of proposed actions on coastal ecosystems, and this document summarizes model development and provides access to the underlying numerical code and other information summarized in this report.

A habitat-type modeling approach was proposed to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the modeling problem. Three overarching systems were identified as potential framing for model development: (1) marine / oceanside systems, (2) estuarine / bayside systems, and (3) network connectivity for the entire ecosystem. For each habitat type the following issues were identified: key sub-types of habitats, construction impacts, operational impacts, direct effects (e.g., footprint effects) vs.Â indirect effects (e.g., changes in circulation), key intermediate processes that a model would need to capture, and key data / modeling resources.

Chapter 5 presents a broad examination of NYBEM relative to system quality, technical quality, and usability, which aligns with USACE model certification requirements (EC 1105-2-412). This appendix presents additional analyses undertaken to compare model outcomes (habitat zones and quality) with existing habitat for the region, which we refer to as output verification (McKay et al.Â 2022). This form of verification generally compares model predictions to independent data sets and includes dozens of methods including not only visual and statistical performance but also correcting for pattern recreation and parameterization issues (Bennett et al.Â 2013). The analyses presented in this chapter are an abbreviated version of broader evaluations against empirical data, which are being prepared for peer-reviewed journal articles (Mahan et al.Â forthcoming; Cordero et al.Â forthcoming). These analysis are conducted for the existing condition of the New Jersey Back Bays study system. This section includes three main elements. First, model parameterization is described for this study site. Second, the suite of verification methods are described, which are applied to all six habitat types. Third, model verification results are summarized for the six habitat types. B.1 New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB) Study System This section presents a preliminary application of the NYBEM to assess ecosystem condition in the New Jersey Back Bays following three main activities: (1) Collection of hydrodynamic model outcomes, (2) Compilation of other environmental input data sets, and (3) Data post-processes and model execution. Additional description of data and models will be included in the NJBB feasibility studys supplemental EIS. B.1.1 Hydrodynamic Modeling NYBEM is capable of reading in hydrodynamic conditions from empirical or modeled data sources. However, hydrodynamic models provide the primary basis for USACE planning because of their capacity to span large spatial domains and forecast outcomes over long time horizons with and without project actions. Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) is the numerical model code applied for hydrodynamic simulations in this study of the New Jersey Back Bays. The two-dimensional (2D) shallow water module of AdH was applied for all simulations, which solves for depth-averaged velocity and salinity throughout the model domain. (More details of the 2D shallow water module of AdH and its computational philosophy and equations are available in Savant et al.Â 2014 and Savant and Berger 2015.) AdH version 4.6 was applied for this study. A 2D AdH model was developed and validated for simulation of hydrodynamics and salinity (Details provided in McAlpin and Ross, draft). The model was validated to available field data for all parameters. Field data were collected in February 2019 for salinity and discharge/velocity data over a 13-hour tidal cycle at three major inlets  Barnegat, Little Egg, and Great Egg. Field data supported the use of a 2D model as opposed to a three-dimensional (3D) model due to lack of major salinity stratification. The model domain was determined using aerial images and bathymetric/topographic data for the area. The Surface Water Modeling System was used to generate a 2D surface mesh and define material regions for applying specific model features, such as bed roughness. The domain is defined horizontally in Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 18 coordinates with units of meters. Vertically it is based on North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) with units of meters. All data applied to the model are shifted to this datum and coordinate system. Bathymetry data for the model were obtained from several sources: the Coastal Relief Model, sponsor collected hydrographic surveys, and the National Elevation Dataset. These data sets were combined such that the latest data were made a priority as well as data collected at finer resolution. The 2D AdH code can include areas that wet/dry; therefore, elevations were included in the domain up to 2 m NAVD88. The model domain includes over 9,867 square miles, extending approximately 115 miles along the New Jersey Atlantic Ocean coastline from Lewes, DE, to Manasquan, NJ. The 2D mesh contains 324,881 elements and 165,514 nodes. Resolution varies across the domain as needed to capture changes in terrain and features. For instance, fine resolution may be used in small wetland channels to accurately capture the conveyance of flow in these areas as well as the salinity that migrates upstream in deeper channels. Analyses are computed for a one-year simulation with 2018 boundary conditions. For this simulation, the following variables were output: Bed elevation Water surface elevations: mean lower low water (MLLW), mean tide level (MTL), mean higher high water (MHHW), and 0 to 100% exceedence by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record) Salinity levels: mean annual and 0 to 100% exceedence by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record) Velocity: mean annual and 0 to 100% exceedence by 10% (calculated over the 2018 period of record) AdH outputs were interpolated from point data using a spline technique with barriers separating the marine and estuarine data points (i.e., salinity data were not interpolated over the barrier island) using ESRI Spatial Analyst Tools. The interpolated surfaces were then rasterized throughout the model domain. A 10m grid cell size was used as a balance between data resolution from the model outcomes, over- vs.Â under-parameterization, and application resolution (i.e., the relevant size of wetlands in the region). B.1.2 Environmental Data Compilation Other environmental inputs are required for NYBEM beyond hydrodynamic inputs. Specifically, model inputs are needed for hard bottom substrates, substrate composition, vegetation cover, urban land use composition, shoreline armoring, and vessel traffic. The estuarine, subtidal model distinguishes hard bottom ecosystems from soft bottom ecosystems (e.g., oysters vs.Â SAV/clams, respectively). Hard bottom habitats are generally required for reef environments, and this cultch substrate is often a limiting factor in the region. These substrates tend to be less mobile and persist through time. As such, we use a map of historical oyster beds as a proxy for the presence or absence of hard bottom substrate. Shellfish maps from 1963 were digitized that show recreational, moderate commercial, and high commercial uses, all of which were merged into a single hard bottom data layer. Substrate composition is a major driving factor in both the estuarine and marine subtidal models. Although many nuanced methods exist for assessing substrate (e.g., grain size, distributional metrics, compaction, etc.), simple composition metrics such as percent sand or fine sediment (silt/clay) suffice for the purpose of NYBEM. Furthermore, other substrate metrics are not available at the scale of the NYBEM model domain. Two data sets were combined for this analysis. First, the usSEABED sampling points are available for much of the study area, but underrepresented in the back bay ecosystems. These data were augmented with additional substrate samples from Stockton University and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), which focused explicitly on the NJBB area. Sampling points from these two data sets were combined into a single point cloud and composition metrics were interpolated across the region. Vegetation cover provides an important and rapid measure of the plant communitys role in ecological function. Cover classes from the NLCD were used to assess this variable. This data set provides cover as a binary (presence / absence) metric at a 30m cell resolution for the entire Nation. A neighborhood analysis was used to translate this binary metric into a continuous variable. Specifically, a moving window assessment was applied with a 50m buffer distance from each raster cell in the NYBEM domain. Vegetation cover percentage was assessed as the mean cover of the cells within this area. The buffer distance of 50m was chosen as large enough to capture multiple cover measurements relative to the grid resolution but small enough to capture the general role of vegetation in the area. NLCD data were also used to assess the effects of urbanization on estuarine and marine intertidal systems. All urban land uses with the NLCD (codes 21, 22, 23, and 24) were reclassified as urban, and all other types were classified as non-urban. As was the case with vegetation cover, a moving window assessment was applied with a 100m buffer distance from each raster cell in the NYBEM domain. Neighboring urban land use was assessed as the mean cover of the cells within this area. The buffer distance of 100m was chosen to reflect the pervasive influence of urban processes (e.g., noise, light, and water quality) even at relatively large distances from a given patch. Shoreline armoring also provides an important metric of human use intensity in the intertidal models. The shoreline armoring data layer is a linear dataset developed by the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration. The layer represents linear areas of the coastal shoreline that are armored (i.e., solid man-made structures, riprap, boulder rubble) as of 2014 (NJ) and 2016 (NY). The Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) guidelines define these uses for the preparation, evaluation, and/or response to threats to the coastal environment such as oil spills. The shoreline was originally delineated at mean higher high water (MHHW) using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and high resolution digital orthophotography datasets. In subtidal and deepwater ecosystems, vessel density provides an important proxy for other human uses like fishing pressure, navigation, and resource extraction. An Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) vessel traffic density raster dataset was generated by the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and NOAA Office for Coastal Management from AIS Marine Cadastral data. This layer represents 2019 annual vessel transit counts of all vessels (i.e., commercial and recreational) summarized at a 100 m by 100 m pixel cell resolution. A single vessel transit is counted each time a vessel track passes through, starts, or stops within a 100 m grid cell. B.1.3 Parameter Forecasting These data sets each represent trade-offs deemed acceptable for this application of the NYBEM. However, different applications could compel use of other data sources. For instance, the NYBEM spatial scale required heavy reliance on regional and national data sets. However, more local applications (e.g., a single bay) could have access to higher resolution data (e.g., locally mapped substrate or shoreline armoring). Data quality and resolution are a common challenge in large scale modeling, and future applications could consider alternative approaches. For this analysis, all data sets were rasterized at the 10m resolution and aligned based on the AdH hydrodynamic data. Table B.1 summarizes all data compilation sources and pre-processing steps. Models were then applied as described in Chapter 4 of this manual. Table B.1: Table B.1. Summary of data compilation, pre-processing, and forecasting assumptions. Use in NYBEM indicates the module or function as follows: zone mapping (zone), freshwater tidal (fre.tid), estuarine intertidal (est.int), estuarine subtidal (est.sub), marine intertidal (mar.int), marine subtidal (mar.sub), and marine deepwater (mar.deep) Data Layer Use in NYBEM Source Data Post-Processing Bed elevation (m) zone AdH none Mean lower low water (m) zone AdH none Mean higher high water (m) zone AdH none 10th Percentile Salinity (psu) zone, est.sub AdH none Hard Bottom Substrate (presence/absence) est.sub Historic Shellfish Maps none Intertidal slope mar.int AdH Derived from AdH elevation data Relative exposure time mar.int AdH (Hmax-Hmin) / (MHHW-MLLW) Percent of Light Available est.sub, mar.sub, mar.deep AdH exp(-1.39*Hmedian) Change in Velocity (%) est.int AdH Percent change from 2018 baseline Mean annual salinity (psu) est.sub AdH none Duration of salinity greater than 0.5 psu fre.tid AdH Interpolated from observation percentiles Relative depth fre.tid, est.int AdH (MHWW-Hmed) / (Hmax-Hmin) Median velocity (cm/s) mar.sub AdH Unit conversion from AdH Duration of salinity less than 28 psu mar.deep AdH Interpolated from observation percentiles Neighborhood emergent vegetation cover (%) fre.tid, est.int, mar.int NLCD Percent of cells within 50m having a vegetated class Neighborhood urban land use (%) est.int, mar.int NLCD Percent of cells within 100m having urban land classes Distance to shoreline armoring features (m) est.in, mar.int NOAA ESI Compute distance from centroid of cell to nearest feature Substrate sand composition (%) est.sub usSEABED + TNC Point data merging and interpolation Substrate fines composition (%) est.sub usSEABED + TNC Point data merging and interpolation Vessel Density (tracks per year) est.sub, mar.sub, mar.deep AIS 2019 tracks intersected with raster B.2 Methods NYBEM contains seven sub-models addressing different habitat types (Chapter 4). Three sub-models were verified against independent data sets, specifically: freshwater tidal, estuarine intertidal, and estuarine subtidal. The marine models were not verified due to a lack of a single direct empirical analog data set (e.g., a wetland map), although these models will be verified in the future against multiple data sets (e.g., species distribution observations, water quality metrics). For each sub-model in the analysis, verification data sets were identified (Table B.2). Specifically, the New Jersey 2012 land use codes (fields, description) and the National Wetland Inventory(fields) served as the primary verification sources. Key attributes or properties of these data sets were extracted for the analysis. All data were aligned with the NYBEM raster mask described above for direct comparison between NYBEM outputs and verification data. Table B.2: Table B.2. Summary of verification data used with each NYBEM sub-model NYBEM Sub-Model Verification Data Attribute or Data Field Freshwater Tidal (fresh.tid) National Wetland Inventory Only riverine, tidal systems (R1) Estuarine Intertidal (est.int) New Jersey Land Use saline marsh (6110) and tidal mud flat (5412) Estuarine Intertidal (est.int) National Wetland Inventory All estuarine, intertidal systems (E2) Estuarine Subtidal (est.sub) National Wetland Inventory Estuarine, subtidal (E1) Three families of preliminary analyses were undertaken for each sub-model and verification data set. First, observed habitats were translate into presence and absence outcomes for every grid cell in the NJBB domain (i.e., 1 and 0, respectively). Modeled habitat zones were also translate into presence-absence data for comparison. These data were used to verify the efficacy of NYBEMs classification methods. For instance, was a given patch correctly or incorrectly categorized as a freshwater tidal ecosystem in the NYBEM relative to a mapped wetland layer? Model results were collected using confusion matrices, which summarize outcomes relative to true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative classifications. These summary metrics are provided for the entire NJBB domain for each data set. The second family of verification analyses focused on NYBEMs habitat suitability predictions. For every patch in a given NYBEM habitat type (e.g., fresh.tid), the overall habitat suitability index (a continuous 0-1 score) was examined relative to presence-absence outcomes from the verification data set. For instance, what was the habitat suitability for all freshwater wetland patches in the verification data set? Ideally, NYBEM would predict high suitability for cells with existing wetlands and low suitability for cells without existing wetlands. Data are summarized for all cells in the NJBB domain with violin diagrams showing the distribution of HSI outcomes relative to presence-absence observations. The third verification analysis examines the overall predictions of NYBEM at large-scales. The total extent of habitat predicted by NYBEM was summarize in both acreage and habitat units (acreage * habitat suitability) for each of the eleven inlets in the NJBB domain. Ideally, NYBEM would predict the same order-of-magnitude of habitat as observed in each inlet. Data are summarized in plots of observed and modeled estimates of acreage and habitat units. Again, the NYBEMs habitat zonation would be expected to over-predict habitat extent, although the predictions should be closer to observations for the habitat units. B.3 Results NYBEM model verification was conducted separately for each sub-model. The following sections summarize verification analyses and discuss the efficacy of the NYBEM as indicated by these outcomes. Notably, model results currently represent an April 2022 version of NYBEM. All modeled outcomes will be updated to reflect this document in September 2022. B.3.1 Freshwater Tidal Model The freshwater tidal sub-model was verified against National Wetland Inventory data, specifically the the riverine tidal class (code: R1). Presence-absence outcomes for each cell in the NJBB domain were used to assess the relative rate of classification error. True positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative rates were 0.0%, 9.70%, 0.01%, and 90.29%, respectively. These analyses indicate high rates of false positivity and dramatic overprediction of the extent of freshwater tidal habitat. The freshwater tidal habitat suitability index was examined relative to the presence and absence of National Wetland Inventory data (Figure B.1). This analysis indicates that NYBEM weakly differentiates habitat quality in patches with and without existing wetlands. Specifically, the mean HSI value for patches with existing wetlands is 0.040 (n=1,555), whereas the mean HSI value for patches without existing wetlands is 0.042 (n=11,705,193). Figure B.1: NYBEM fresh.tid verification relative HSI outcomes in observed NWI patches. The final verification analysis examines the aggregate predictions of habitat extent across large-scales. Specifically, the extent of habitat predicted by NYBEM relative to observed habitat on an inlet-by-inlet basis. Figure B.2A shows NYBEM predictions of habitat area only, and Figure B.2B shows habitat quantity and quality via the combined habitat unit. Both estimates dramatically over-predicts habitat extent by an order-of-magnitude. Figure B.2: NYBEM fresh.tid verification relative to the extent of habitat predicted across eleven inlets. Based on these outcomes, the fresh.tid model significantly over-predicts ecosystem extent relative to both binary (i.e., presence-absence) and continuous (i.e., HSI) outcomes. As such, the model should not be used to numerically estimate the extent or quality freshwater ecosystems. However, the model does strongly differentiate estimates of habitat extent and quality by inlet (Figure B.2), which could indicate that relative comparison between systems may be appropriate. B.3.2 Estuarine Intertidal Model The estuarine intertidal sub-model was verified against the State of New Jerseys land use classes (codes: 6110 and 5412) and the National Wetland Inventory (code: E2). Presence-absence outcomes for each cell in the NJBB domain were used to assess the relative rate of classification error. For the New Jersey wetlands, true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative rates were 22.81%, 9.95%, 12.30%, and 54.94%, respectively. For the National Wetland Inventory, true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative rates were 23.48%, 9.28%, 14.39%, and 52.85%, respectively. These analyses indicate high rates of correct classification (i.e., &gt;75%) and low rates of misclassification (i.e., &lt;25%). The estuarine intertidal habitat suitability index was examined relative to the presence and absence of the New Jersey and NWI data sets (Figure B.3). This analysis indicates that NYBEM strongly differentiates habitat quality in patches with and without existing wetlands. Specifically, the mean HSI value for NJ wetlands is 0.577 (n=4,108,222), whereas the mean HSI value for patches without existing wetlands is 0.112 (n=7,592,726). The mean HSI value for NWI wetlands is 0.549 (n=4,431,105), whereas the mean HSI value for patches without existing wetlands is 0.109 (n=7,269,846). Figure B.3 also visualizes the misclassification rates discussed above, where false positives appear in the absence data with high HSI (~0.70) and false negatives appear in the presence data with low HSI (~0.0). Figure B.3: NYBEM fresh.tid verification relative HSI outcomes in observed NJ and NWI patches. The aggregate predictions of estuarine intertidal ecosystems across inlets also indicates high model utility (Figure B.4). Total extent of the ecosystem generally aligns well with observed mapping with a bias toward under-prediction (Figures B.4A and B.4C), although some data points deviate significantly (e.g., NYBEM estimates at Barnegat Inlet are lower than NWI observations). NYBEM habitat quality estimates are systematically biased toward under-prediction of wetlands in both the NJ and NWI data (Figures B.4B and B.4D). Notably, the mapped wetlands are not intending to assess quality of given patches. The NYBEM predictions also demonstrate utility in distinguishing the relative amounts of this ecosystem type across inlets, which would indicate strong utility for assessing relative comparisons with the model (e.g., without and with project conditions). Figure B.4: NYBEM est.int verification relative to the extent of habitat predicted across eleven inlets. Based on these outcomes, the est.int model reasonably predicts ecosystem extent relative to both binary (i.e., presence-absence) and continuous (i.e., HSI) outcomes. As such, the model could provide a useful framework for estimating a general range of numerical estimates of habitat quantity and quality, and the spread of estimates across inlets indicates high utility for relative comparison between actions at large scales. B.3.3 Estuarine Subtidal Model The estuarine subtidal sub-model was verified against the National Wetland Inventory (code: E1). Presence-absence outcomes for each cell in the NJBB domain were used to assess the relative rate of classification error. For the National Wetland Inventory, true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative rates were 39.57%, 6.05%, 11.15%, and 43.23%, respectively. These analyses indicate high rates of correct classification (i.e., &gt;82%) and low rates of misclassification (i.e., &lt;18%). The estuarine subtidal habitat suitability index was examined relative to the presence and absence of the NWI data sets (Figure B.5). This analysis indicates that NYBEM strongly differentiates habitat quality in patches with and without existing wetlands. Specifically, the mean HSI value for NWI wetlands is 0.630 (n=5,937,692), whereas the mean HSI value for patches without existing wetlands is 0.108 (n=5,769,056). Figure B.5 also visualizes the misclassification rates discussed above, where false positives appear in the absence data with high HSI (&gt;0.70) and false negatives appear in the presence data with low HSI (~0.0). Figure B.5: NYBEM est.sub verification relative HSI outcomes in observed NWI patches. The aggregate predictions of estuarine subtidal ecosystems across inlets also indicates high model utility (Figure B.6). Total extent of the ecosystem generally aligns well with observed mapping with a bias toward under-prediction (Figure B.6A). NYBEM habitat quality estimates are systematically biased toward under-prediction of wetlands in the NWI data (Figure B.6B). Notably, the mapped NWI wetlands are not intending to assess quality of given patches. The NYBEM predictions also demonstrate utility in distinguishing the relative amounts of this ecosystem type across inlets, which would indicate strong utility for assessing relative comparisons with the model (e.g., without and with project conditions). Figure B.6: NYBEM est.sub verification relative to the extent of habitat predicted across eleven inlets. Based on these outcomes, the est.sub model reasonably predicts ecosystem extent relative to both binary (i.e., presence-absence) and continuous (i.e., HSI) outcomes. As such, the model could provide a useful framework for estimating a general range of numerical estimates of habitat quantity and quality, and the spread of estimates across inlets indicates high utility for relative comparison between actions at large scales. B.4 Summary The preliminary verification presented here generally lends confidence to the use of NYBEM for relative prediction at large spatial scales. More specifically, the analyses show similar ranges of modeled and observed acreages for the est.int and est.sub models. However, the freshwater tidal model dramatically over-predicts ecosystem extent. This is likely due to the model not limiting outcomes to tidal systems (which were used in verification), but instead including all freshwater wetlands. Analyses are underway to better understand the poor rate of classification. The est.int and est.sub models also strongly differentiate habitat suitability predictions among sites with and without wetlands. This finding indicates that the models generally distinguish between features strongly, and the HSI formulation may provide value for distinguishing ecosystem condition. Importantly, the analyses presented here are merely preliminary forms of verification being pursued for NYBEM. First, the marine models were not included in this analysis, and data compilation is underway for validating those models. Second, the approaches used here are somewhat blunt tools in the large spectrum of spatially explicit model validation methods. For instance, more nuanced methods addressing issues such as spatial autocorrelation will be pursued as models develop. Third, more sophisticated verification data sets will be used like the NWI sub-classes, rather than simply the tidal and salinity criteria. These additional analyses will be published in peer-reviewed journals to vet the utility of the NYBEM framework for large-scale prediction and comparison of ecosystem condition. "],["usace-model-certification-review.html", "C USACE Model Certification Review C.1 Reviewer-1 C.2 Reviewer-2 C.3 Reviewer-3 C.4 Reviewer-4", " C USACE Model Certification Review Model evaluation is the process for ensuring that numerical tools are scientifically defensible and transparently developed. Evaluation is often referred to as verification or validation, but it in fact includes a family of methods ranging from peer review to model testing to error checking (Schmolke et al.Â 2010). The USACE has established an ecological model certification process to ensure that planning models are sound and functional. These generally consist of evaluating tools relative to the three following categories: system quality, technical quality, and usability (EC 1105-2-412). The NYBEM underwent USACE review and certification from April through August 2022. An April 2022 version of the models were reviewed by four reviewers representing coastal ecology (two USACE New England District biologists, Reviewer-1 and Reviewer-2), an experienced R-programmer (USACE Environmental Laboratory, Reviewer-3), and a modeling policy expert (USACE Ecosystem Restoration Planning Center of Expertise, Reviewer-4). All comments follow the four-part comment structure of: (1) identify the problem, (2) describe the technical basis for the comment, (3) rate the significance or impact of the problem, and (4) recommend a mechanism for resolution. Comments and author responses are provided for transparency in review processes and long-term archival. C.1 Reviewer-1 Comment 1.1: Section 3.2 - The Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) was endorsed by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in 2012. As an FGDC standard, federally funded projects working with environmental data in coastal and marine settings should attempt to use CMECS as their primary classification system or attempt to crosswalk their system. Basis: Because USACE is a federal agency and because this project is federally funded, the NYBEM conceptual model should classify ecosystem and habitat types in accordance with CMECS to promote the standardization of habitat/ecosystem classification. Furthermore, CMECS is decades more contemporary than Cowardin et al.Â (1979) and USFWS (1997). However, I understand that NYBEM is, in part, built off of other models that use different classification systems, so adopting CMECS may be difficult. Furthermore, because the goal of NYBEM is not necessarily to classify habitats but to assess the effects of hurricane barrier projects, a case can be made that it isnt necessary to adopt CMECS. However, if the long-term goal is to develop this model into something that can be used in a broader capacity (i.e., in other regions for different coastal projects), then an attempt should be made to incorporate CMECS. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Least effort resolution is to include a statement as to why the current classification standard was chosen and a nod to why CMECS was not used as the primary classification standard, given the call for federal agencies to use CMECS. Author Response: Non-concur. CMECS classifies ecosystems based on two major factors: (1) the aquatic setting and (2) the biogeographic setting. The aquatic setting is defined relative to salinity, depth, and tidal zones, which largely align with the NYBEM zonation scheme. The biogeographic setting is defined by regional setting, and a series of increasingly detailed filters related to water column, geoform, substrate, and biotic components. These detailed data were unavailable at the regional scale to map these features for the existing condition as well as forecast shifts in zonation through time. However, the model scope generally defines a biogeographic region (i.e., the New York Bight), and other biogeographic components were incorporated where data supported their use (e.g., a differentiation between soft and hard bottom habitats in the estuarine subtidal model). Section 3.2 has been expanded and enriched to better describe the delineation of ecosystem types as well as the alignment of multiple classifications (CMECS, Cowardin, etc.). Comment 1.2: Section 4.2.1 - Why does the freshwater tidal zone suitability index increase with an increase in time greater than 0.5 PSU? Basis: If the theory is that periodic tidal influx of saltwater is beneficial to freshwater marshes through processes of sediment and nutrient deposition, but an excess of saltwater can have a harmful effect on freshwater emergent vegetation, then shouldnt the index curve be bell-shaped (i.e., peaking at moderate salinity durations and dropping off at high and low durations)? Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Provide a justification for the current curve or revise the salinity index per the above logic. Author Response: Concur The suitability curve was incorrect and has been amended to align with the logic of low levels of salinity as a stimuli and high levels of salinity as a source of harm. Comment 1.3: Section 4.3.1 - Justify the assumption that mean current velocity and estuarine edge erosion rates are directly correlated. Basis: Is it possible to directly measure and model edge erosion (possibly from remote sensing such as aerial or satellite imagery)? It seems possible that in some instances (due to certain physical and biological aspects of a particular estuary) increasing velocities could potentially increase sediment accretion and decrease edge erosion (possibly by mobilizing larger quantities and larger grained sediments from outside of the estuary and depositing them into upper estuarine environments). I understand the logic and the simplicity of modeling edge erosion this way, but tidal level and wave action play important roles in this dynamic too. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Not necessarily recommending a change but merely suggesting taking some time to think about this index and whether there is a way to improve it within the limitations of time, budget, modeling constraints, etc. Author Response: Concur. Direct measurement of erosion would be preferable. However, there were not available methods for long-term forecasting of erosion metrics like shoreline retreat. Changes in velocity were viewed as a compromise between availability and accuracy. Notably, we have changed the focal velocity from an average velocity to the 90th percentile velocity to better reflect the timing of erosion (i.e., during storm conditions). Comment 1.4: Section 4.3.4 - Is there a well justified reason that the estuarine intertidal land use suitability index relationship is it not linear?. Basis: Why would 50% urban development receive a score of 1.0, and further why would 50% urban development receive the same score as 0% development? It seems to me like the relationship should be linear with a slope of -1x, with 0% urban development receiving a score of 1.0, and 100% urban development receiving a score of 0.0. Notably, there may be reasons for not wanting to penalize estuaries and marshes due to their proximity to urban development. Significance: Low. Recommended Resolution: Provide a justification in the text. Author Response: Concur. The model initially used a threshold of 50% urban development to avoid penalizing marshes in urban areas. However, the threshold was reduced to 10% to better align with observed declines in ecological condition in the region and general changes in performance in other ecosystems (e.g., stream ecosystems typically degrade beyond ~10% urban development). Additional text was added to justify this change. Comment 1.5: Section 4.4 - First, it was assumed that essential fish habitat would be present if oysters, SAV, and clams were present, so this variable was removed. Revisit this assumption. Basis: NOAA EFH is a species-specific habitat characterization. So, SAV habitat is EFH for only certain species of fish. For some species, muddy or sandy bottoms are EFH, for some cobble or ledge habitat is EFH. It also depends on the life stage of the species in question (e.g., use of SAV for nursery grounds but not for adult foraging, etc.). Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Maybe Im misunderstand the assumption being made but regardless I would suggest reading, incorporating, and referencing the EFH source documents for the focal taxa that the model is using as surrogates . Author Response: Concur. This comment was intended in the colloquial use of essential fish habitat rather than the regulatory definition of EFH. The intent was to state that fish habitat quality was generally reflected by the indicator taxa. The text has been clarified accordingly. Comment 1.6: Section 4.4 - Here, we use a historical map of oyster reef extent as a proxy for hard bottom with the assumption that hard substrate is relatively immobile and these locations would likely have higher potential for oyster reestablishment. What about gravel, cobble, and ledge habitat? Basis: Are these types of geologic hard-bottom habitats present within the study areas? If so, I think they should be included. Cobble and ledge habitat have high ecological and commercial importance and should probably be considered. If a hurricane barrier project alters the amount of hard-bottom, then that would be important to know, especially because a lot of coastal New Jersey and the New York Bight are soft-bottom habitat. For example, ledges provide habitat for kelp, benthic macroalgae, attaching sessile organisms, lobsters, and many fish species. Cobble reefs serve as a nursery for juvenile lobsters and cod. This seems important for an ecological model. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Incorporate geological substrate or explain that the estuarine, subtidal zone is going to be represented with focal taxa, and that hard-bottom is going to be represented by oyster cultch even though other hard-bottom habitat types exist. Author Response: Concur. Data availability limited our capacity to include these habitat types, and the text was clarified as follows to reflect this assumption. Additional substrates such as gravel, cobble, or ledge provide important habitat and ecological functions, but these habitats were not considered due to a lack of data availability for the large focal area. Comment 1.7: Section 4.4.2.1 - Clarify whether SAV represents vascular plants, marine benthic macroalgae, or both? Basis: Both seagrasses and benthic macroalgae fall under the category of SAV but require different substrates for ideal habitat. Seagrasses require silt/sand for root expansion and nutrient uptake, while benthic macroalgae requires coarse substrates for attachment (shell reefs, shell rubble, cobbles, boulders, ledge, etc.) . In section 4.4.2.1, the authors write that substrate is represented as the presence of soft-bottom sediments conducive for SAV growth. Based on Short et al.Â (2002), optimal conditions for growth were identified as non-cobble substrates with less than 70% fine sediment. The issue is that the Short et al.Â (2002) paper is solely dealing with Zostera marina habitat suitability, not benthic macroalgae habitat suitability. However, many studies have found that benthic macroalgae plays an important role in photosynthesis, nursery habitat, habitat structure, etc. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Consult definitions of SAV such as those in encyclopedia.com and from NOAA. The NOAA definition mentions macroalgae but focuses on seagrass. Consider breaking out SAV into two groups (seagrass and benthic macroalgae) or revise the text to be specific to seagrasses and other vascular plants. Author Response: Concur. Section 4.4.2.1 was amended to clarify the generality of the term SAV and the focus on seagrass in this model. Comment 1.8: Section 4.5 - Sea turtles shouldnt be mentioned in the marine, intertidal zone module. Basis: Sea turtles typically nest in the very upper reaches of the intertidal zone or above the intertidal zone, otherwise their eggs could be smothered in water (embryos unable to respire) or washed away. But more importantly, there arent any sea turtles that spawn north of the Carolinas on the Atlantic Coast. Sea turtles are certainly found in the waters off of New York and New Jersey in the Summer and Fall, but not usually in the intertidal zone. Any turtles found on beaches in the intertidal zone are likely resting or stranded. The Dunkin et al.Â (2016) paper is focused on a study site in southern Florida, so it shouldnt be used for NYBEM. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: Remove sea turtle nesting from habitat suitability. Author Response: Concur. The reference was initially included as an example structure of a habitat suitability model, and the numerical models did not draw directly from the suitability indices. The citation was removed accordingly. Comment 1.9: Section 4.5 - The marine, intertidal zone module is solely focused on beach habitat. Basis: The use of beach slope and vegetation cover make the marine, intertidal zone module a metric of sandy beach quality. What about natural and man-made hard-bottom intertidal areas? Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: This is probably fine, because my understanding is that most of the intertidal areas of concern within the studies areas are sandy beaches. I would suggest maybe just mentioning this in the text. Author Response: Concur. The focus on sandy beaches was clarified at the beginning of the section. Comment 1.10: Section 4.5.4 - Vegetation cover doesnt seem like an appropriate index for the suitability of marine, intertidal habitat. Basis: Beach grasses and shrubs only occur in the upper reaches of the intertidal zone, so Im not sure if it should be used as a metric for the entirety of the marine intertidal zone? In some cases, vegetative cover is preferred by certain species at certain times, such as piping plovers, which often use beach grasses to hide their chicks after theyve hatched. Many colonial nesting shorebirds (like terns) prefer open sandy habitat but that doesnt mean all shorebirds do. Many shorebirds nest in beach grasses and shrubs, such as Spotted Sandpipers, Willets, and others. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: I would suggest rethinking and updating the marine, intertidal vegetation cover index. Author Response: Concur. The suitability curve was removed from the analysis to avoid conflicting suitability needs in this ecosystem. Comment 1.11: Section 4.6.2 - Why does marine subtidal habitat suitability decrease linearly with percent fine substrate? Basis: The ecological logic of this metric is unclear. Subtidal habitats with fine sediments can be optimal habitat for many important filter-feeding benthic invertebrates and thus provide important foraging habitat for demersal fish species (e.g., winter flounder, cod, etc.). Some undisturbed soft-bottom subtidal habitats can have high benthic invertebrate diversity and density. At the same time, so can hard-bottom habitats or sandy habitats, they just have different communities, not necessarily better ones. More important than grain-size is habitat heterogeneity. Having a mix of different benthic habitats that support different communities and different life stages of benthic and demersal species is more optimal than having just one type of habitat type regardless of its perceived suitability. Additional information can be found in Kritzer et al.Â 2016. Significance: Medium. Recommended Resolution: This index is probably centered around hard clam sediment suitability, but hard clams may not represent the entire marine subtidal ecosystem well. Reconsider the substrate index in the marine, subtidal zone module, but at the very least mention that it is centered on hard clam suitability. Author Response: Concur. The section was reworded to indicate the focus on hard clam habitat. The model was also modified to reflect a suitability index of 0.1 when fines equal 100%. The broader challenge of incorporating a mosaic of habitats was not feasible within the confines of this patch-based model. Comment 1.12: Section 4.6 - The Marine, Subtidal Module is essentially focused on only two taxa: hard clams and seagrasses. Basis: The statement: NYBEMs marine subtidal submodel provides a useful framework for estimating general ecosystem condition is contradicted by the fact that it is only focused on the suitability of hard clams and seagrass. What about other benthic invertebrates? What about coastal fishes? Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: The marine, subtidal zone module either needs to be expanded to include a suite of taxa or be heavily caveated in the text. Author Response: Concur. Section 4.6.5 was heavily revised to reflect the limitations of this simple model. Comment 1.13: Section 4.7 - The marine, deepwater zone should probably include metrics such as dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, turbidity etc. Basis: From an ecological perspective, the indices used for the marine, deepwater zone are not adequate to predict the suitability of that particular habitat type. I understand that the metrics used in the model are more readily available than some of those proposed here, but it would be beneficial to attempt to incorporate some of these metrics. For example, sea surface temperature (SST) data are available from NOAA, although the direct tie into the model is not clear. If a hurricane barrier caused less influx of cool deepwater water into an estuary, then it could cause SST in the estuary to rise which would have a negative effect on many taxa, including seagrasses. Rising SST is also correlated with algal blooms, carbon release from the seafloor, and many other phenomena. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: If possible, expand the Marine, Deepwater Zone module. Author Response: Non-concur. The authors agree with the principle of the comment. However, these metrics were not incorporated due to patchy availability of existing data through space and time (i.e., only at monitoring sites) and a general inability to forecast these metrics through time. For instance, SST would provide more refined predictions, but this would require a family of water quality models not currently being developed for this study. Comment 1.14: The NYBEM would benefit from additional input from estuarine and coastal marine ecologists from academia, non-profit organizations, state, and federal agencies, etc. In particular, addition input on the most appropriate focal / surrogate taxa for each sub-model would be helpful, and sub-models could then be built from those particular taxa. Basis: Often while reading through the NYBEM documentation, the question of suitable habitat for what taxa would arise? The idea of suitable habitat is a species-specific concept (e.g., suitable subtidal habitat for lobster or blue crab is vastly different than subtidal habitat for striped bass or bluefish). Seagrass and hard clams may be appropriate focal taxa, but their use in NYBEM may be overstated. Sub-models such as the marine, subtidal zone and the marine, deepwater zone could be improved by adopting different focal taxa and building indices accordingly. Federally endangered taxa may be an appropriate starting point, given the use for federal projects. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: NYBEM could be constructed around 1-3 focal taxa for each sub-model, which are clearly specified in the text and from which the indices are clearly related. This approach would potentially alleviate a lot of the comments above. Author Response: Non-concur. NYBEM was constructed in the method recommended. A series of workshops with technical stakeholders were held in 2019 to identify key processes and indicator taxa. The models presented here represent a blended approach, which uses proxy variables from numerous sources and balances those variables with a need to assess outcomes across a large spatial scale. C.2 Reviewer-2 Comment 2.1: Section 3.2 and 4.1 - The ecosystem types were adopted from a combination of two existing classifications: (Cowardin et al.Â 1979; USFWS 1997). Adopt existing ecosystem classifications. - Basis: The use and modification of less broadly used systems creates confusion and leads to some metrics being applied inappropriately, particularly with the use of salinity, which is very variable, as a classification factor. The model output in Section 6.3 shows what would generally be classified as estuarine habitat as marine habitat. - Significance: High. The outputs would be more readily understandable to a wider audience if the model used a standard classification system. - Recommended Resolution: Change to Cowardin et al.Â (1979) or CMECS in any future iterations of the model. - Author Response: Non-concur. See response to Comment 1.1. The classification used here was a blend of the two recommended classifications. Section 3.2 was modified extensively to better describe the rationale. Comment 2.2: Section 4.0 - Finally, a numerical suitability index was developed for each variable remaining in the sub-model, which were based on existing suitability indices, published thresholds / responses, and professional judgment. The definition of the suitability index is unclear. Basis: Throughout the model documentation, the text refers to the suitability index. Suitability implies that the result will answer how suitable the habitat is for a particular thing (suitability = right or appropriate for a particular person, purpose, or situation), but thats generally not well defined in the text. The question is, What is the cover type particularly suited for if it gets a 1.0 optimal rating? It would be more appropriate to refer to the y axis output as a quality index as is done here: Where Ifresh.tid is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the freshwater, tidal zone, but, even in that case, specifically what the index means should be clearly and completely defined. One possibility given the nature of the alternatives with the most potential significant effects  i.e., storm surge barriers  would be to develop and call the index a resilience index. That may support the salinity, relative depth and episodic sediment deposition metrics. Significance: High. Its critical for users to understand model outputs. Defining what is meant by suitability or quality would also guide the model team in developing appropriate inputs. Recommended Resolution: The model outputs should be defined. Define what suitability (or quality) means throughout the model documentation. Author Response: Concur. Section 4.0 was modified to clarify that suitability is used herein as a generalized notion of ecosystem condition scaled from 0 to 1. The term suitability is adopted from the habitat modeling literature due to familiarity of use in the USACE. Comment 2.3: Section 4.2.1 - Where Ifresh.tid is an overarching index of ecosystem quality for the freshwater, tidal zone, salinity is a suitability index relative to salinity, veg.cover is a suitability index relative to vegetative cover, and deposition is a suitability index relative to episodic deposition of sediment. All indices are quality metrics scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 is unsuitable and 1 is ideal. The documentation doesnt provide sufficient reasoning for metrics or the curve shapes. Basis: The documentation should explicitly state what the suitability index supports and provide the reasoning for the shape of the lines in the graphs. The justification for the salinity metric is that Salinity concentration influences many chemical and physical ecological processes within the tidal freshwater ecosystem and supports euryhaline organisms. The salinity metric graph seems to be upside down; if a marsh is above 0.5 psu 20-100% of the time it gets an SI of 1, but that would mean its not a tidal freshwater marsh (TFW) marsh. The SI also seems to be an index of sustainability of the TFW marsh measured by salinity. Its hard to imagine how the salinity metric will be applied to the project alternatives. Under existing conditions, all TFW marshes would get the highest rating, otherwise, they wouldnt be TFW marshes. At some point, under the no action alternative and sea level rise, the estuarine zone would migrate upstream so the TFW marsh would become salt marsh and any upstream non-tidal freshwater marsh would become TFW marsh. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, and I dont see a way for the model to pick up that change. With a floodgate project, the salinity will also creep up with increasingly frequent inundation under normal astronomic tides, but the marsh wont experience as many or as high of storm tides. With the floodgate, the marsh wont necessarily need the pulses of sediment from coastal sources (if they get up that far) because the normal tide elevations eventually wont increase depending on the water elevation when the gates will be closed and the speed and height of SLR. It seems like it would be a pretty complex thing to figure out the percent of the time that the marsh is flooded with water greater than 0.5 psu that would have an adverse effect, especially on the low end of the graph  e.g., the difference between 5% and 15%. TFW marshes are defined based on average annual salinity. Basis: The documentation doesnt seem to support the metrics sufficiently or be explicitly linked to project decision making. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: Salinity may not be an appropriate measure of quality. Its more a measure of what type of marsh it is or sustainability of TFW marsh. Im not sure this model is the way to evaluate changes in salinity with the project alternatives, so Id either provide additional reasoning and documentation or drop this metric. Author Response: Concur. The suitability curve was incorrect and has been amended to align with the logic of low levels of salinity as a stimuli and high levels of salinity as a source of harm. The salinity metric is not intended to capture habitat switching as described, which is accounted for in the habitat zonation algorithms (Sections 3.2 and 4.1). The model is agnostic to the management actions, and instead simply asks, If this patch is a freshwater tidal zone, how does salinity influence the condition of the patch? Finally, the authors agree that salinity modeling is challenging, and the NYBEM does not attempt to mechanistically model salinity, but instead adopts salinity forecasts from the Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) software and simulations. Comment 2.4: Section 4.2.2 - For the NYBEM tidal freshwater ecosystem submodel, vegetation cover is quantified as the percentage of emergent aquatic vegetation. Emergent aquatic vegetation is a key habitat resource for species found within this ecosystem like marsh wren, and marsh wren are a key indicator species of ecosystem health because they are drawn to ideal wetland conditions. These important avian taxa are highly territorial and have a minimum habitat area of 50% emergent vegetation coverage (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). Marsh wrens rarely breed in marshes with less than 57% emergent vegetation (Gutzwiller and Anderson 1987). As a result, if there is less than this quantity of wetland habitat (emergent vegetation), the suitability index is presumed to be 0. Modify suitability curve and/or clarify documentation to reflect focus on marsh wren. Basis: There is insufficient justification for the shape of the graph line. Above this section the documentation says that, veg.cover is a suitability index relative to vegetative cover. The documentation would be clearer if it said, veg.cover is a suitability index that indicates [the capacity of the marsh to support marsh wrens],or whatever its specific purpose is. Here, the text is implying that veg.cover is an index of habitat quality for marsh wrens. This puts a lot of weight on this single variable for a single species. The graph is only explicitly trying to represent one species and there are many more using this habitat type. 50% and less vegetation cover is certainly not worthless habitat and a marsh with 50% vegetative cover is optimum for some species and general abundance of species. A quick search on hemi-marsh comes up with this from Audubon: A hemi-marsh is a type of marsh that is roughly equal parts open water and emergent vegetation or plant life. Since hemi-marsh inherently provides a diverse habitat structure, it attracts a variety of birds and other wildlife species. The graph is not shaped correctly considering other species that might use the habitat type, but I dont think we can draw a graph that will be useful in this situation. I think the team has to consider that whats there on a site is good and then project future changes and determine whether they are good or not. The team could consider fully incorporating and applying several HEP models, but Im not sure that would be worth the effort given the nature of the changes casued by the project alternatives. I would not say that marsh wrens are a key indicator species of ecosystem health because they are drawn to ideal wetland conditions. They are drawn to ideal habitat conditions just like any other species and settle for the habitat that is available to them as long as it meets their minimum requirements. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: The team could consider fully incorporating and applying several HEP models, but Im not sure that would be worth the effort given the nature of the changes with the project alternatives. Author Response: Concur. The suitability index was modified to consider a more general notion of vegetation-to-water ratios, and the text was augmented accordingly. Comment 2.5: Section 4.2.3  Episodic sediment deposition requires large magnitude flooding events beyond typical tidal inundation. As such, we develop a metric to assess the relative difference in depth beyond the common tidal datum of MHHW (see equation below). This relative depth metric goes to zero when there is no flooding beyond MHHW, and the metric equals one when flood magnitude is equal to MHHW. The documentation fails to establish the theoretical basis for this metric and the formula appears to be incorrect. Basis: The documentation does not establish the theoretical basis for the relative depth index, and there seem to be problems with the formula. The documentation needs to describe what Hmedian and Hmax are. If my check is right, if Hmedian (the elevation of a particular patch?) equals HMHHW, Hrel is 0 and the SI is 1 no matter what the Hmax is. Also, the same amount of flooding (Hmax) over a lower point on the marsh gets a lower SI than a higher point. Its not clear why that would be. The documentation also doesnt describe why the sediment deposition SI maxes out at a about 0.05 Hrel. More importantly than the formula, the documentation should provide the rationale for why the relative depth would matter. I could see the actual depth mattering up to a point. Most marshes are pretty flat (certainly high salt marshes are relatively flat) and the hydraulic model results from whatever hydraulic model is being run for the project will indicate the depth of flooding over any patch of marsh. As the documentation says, increased inundation in tidal freshwater marshes leads to more inorganic sediment deposition, which can assist tidal wetlands keep up with rising sea levels, but wouldnt it be simpler to indicate the depth of flooding necessary to maintain sufficient sediment deposition and above which detrimental effects may occur. I believe a hydraulic engineer (or hydraulic model) could estimate these thresholds based on sediment concentration and shear stress and other effects of inundation. The usefulness of this metric should be considered relative to the anticipated changes in tidal hydraulics with the floodgate alternatives under the future without project conditions, project alternatives, and sea level rise scenarios and their effects on marsh sustainability. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: The usefulness of this metric should be considered relative to the anticipated changes in tidal hydraulics with the floodgate alternatives under the future without project conditions, project alternatives, and sea level rise scenarios and their effects on marsh sustainability and revise or delete the metric appropriately. Author Response: Concur. The definition of the relative depth metric was clarified, and the metric was rederived to align more clearly with suitability. This approach to sediment deposition is linked directly to hydrodynamic change that could result from storm surge barriers. Comment 2.6: Section 4.2 - Reconsider the overall formula for freshwater tidal habitat suitability. - Basis: The overall formula Ifresh.tid = (salinity+veg.cover+deposition)/3 seems to be mixing metrics that support different components of TFW marsh quality. Veg.cover seems to be based on habitat value while salinity and deposition appear to be based on sustainability. Im not sure it makes sense to combine them into one index. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Review and revise the formula as appropriate. - Author Response: Non-concur. The NYBEM seeks to develop generalized metrics of ecosystem condition that reflect multiple aspects of ecological structure and function. The formula for this system provides one such example. Comment 2.7: Section 4.3.1 Edge Erosion - We assume that any increase in average velocity beyond 10% is detrimental, and that increases beyond 30% would fundamentally alter the character of a given marsh. Some theoretical justification should be provided for this metric and statement. Basis: Edge erosion will depend on the characteristics of the marsh and the composition of the sediment, and since its a percentage metric, existing current speeds. The potential outcomes are that: (a) velocity stays the same under existing conditions = 1.0 SI, (b) velocity increases in the FWOP without a tide gate at some point decreasing the SI, and (c) velocity may increase less with a tide gate giving a lower decrease in SI than FWOP or an increase in the SI. Given the potential outcomes and the fact that this may say that having the barrier will have a better ecological outcome for this metric, it should have sufficient justification. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: Provide theoretical justification for the breakpoints in the curve. Author Response: Concur. Text was augmented to bolster this description. See also response to Comment 1.3. Comment 2.8: 4.3.2 Vegetation Cover  This metric also needs more explanation other than the fact that it is adopted from a comparable suitability curve from the Wetland Value Assessment in the Gulf Coast. - Basis: Need to know the basis for the shape of the line in the graph. Ponds and pannes on salt marshes add wildlife value. I assume thats not a consideration for this model and that its intended to document change as the result of changes in hydraulics with the floodgate alternatives. Any assumptions about coverage of ponds and pannes should be explained and/or reflected in the graph. The documentation should also explain how it considers any deterioration in marsh vegetation due to sea level rise. It would help to indicate where the inputs for these metrics come from  i.e., for this one, the documentation should describe how the predictions about changes in percent cover are being made to be input to this model. - Significance: Medium. - Recommended Resolution: Provide additional justification for the shape of the line and where inputs come from. - Author Response: Concur. Text was augmented to better describe the logic of this variable. Comment 2.9: 4.3.3 Episodic Sediment Deposition  see comments on section 4.2.3. This section describes the complex interactions of sediment transport on marshes, but settles on a simple metric without and transitional explanation. - Basis: This section should contain the reasons or basis for why you have the concern described above. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: See comments on section 4.2.3. - Author Response: Concur. Text edited accordingly. See response to Comment 2.5. Comment 2.10: 4.3.4 Development of Adjacent Upland - The documentation doesnt provide sufficient justification for this suitability curve. Basis: The model documentation does not explain how the adjacent development affects the quality of the salt marsh. Is it about the ability for multiple taxa to use the shoreline as migratory pathways or is it about allowing for marsh expansion with SLR? The SLAMM Model assesses the capacity of salt marshes to migrate with SLR. For the NYBEM, habitat suitability is modeled as a function of urban development for adjacent uplands. When the percentage of adjacent urban land uses is greater than 50%, habitat suitability in the estuarine intertidal ecosystem declines. When the development of adjacent upland reaches 100% of the estuarine intertidal ecosystem, the habitat is no longer be considered suitable. The first sentence needs a citation or additional information to support its use. The documentation should say what it is being considered suitable for. Salt marshes within 100 meters of development may have more value in terms of environmental justice values, and as much value for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms. This means that any patch of salt marsh or intertidal flats within 100 meters of development will be valued lower, but patches within the same marsh &gt;100 m from the development will be valued higher. Is that practical? Also, its not clear how this metric would change with the various scenarios  FWOPC, structures, floodgates, and, given the nature of the areas to which the model will be applied (most likely increasing the size and height of existing structures), maybe its not necessary. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: Provide clearer documentation or delete the metric. Author Response: Concur. The model initially used a threshold of 50% urban development to avoid penalizing marshes in urban areas. However, the threshold was reduced to 10% to better align with observed declines in ecological condition in the region and general changes in performance in other ecosystems (e.g., stream ecosystems typically degrade beyond ~10% urban development). Additional text was added to justify this change. See also response to Comment 1.4. Comment 2.11: 4.3.5 Shoreline Armoring  For the NYBEM, the distance to the nearest armored shoreline is used to derive information about the ability for multiple taxa to use the shoreline as migratory pathways. Additional description of the logic is required. Basis: Theres a lot of description of shoreline armoring in the documentation, but then the model settles on interruption of migratory pathways as the reason for the graph and formula. Therefore, suitability in this case means the capacity of the shoreline to allow animals to travel between the estuarine habitat (e.g., salt marsh, mudflat, beach) and the adjacent uplands. The reasoning would then be that wildlife that cant migrate between the estuarine habitat and the upland habitat. Somehow that makes the quality of the marsh half as high as habitats without armoring within the first 100 meters. The justification for the relationship needs to be provided. Since any project would have a structure at all distances (0-100 m) between the structure and the habitat, this should be a bar graph with some value for 0-100 m, rather than a line. It seems like this metric would only provide useful information to assess the effects of shoreline armoring structures. Any NNBF alternative would have to consider the specific effects at the location because the NNBF feature would have to allow for migratory pathways to reduce the effect of armoring  i.e., not just be placed in front an armored shoreline. For a shoreline that already has armoring where the alternative would increase its size, it would not change the rating. For sites without armoring, it would reduce the value of the nearest 100 meters. I dont think theres a strong case to decrease the value of a salt marsh because its near a structure given the project alternatives. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: Add documentation to support the metric, delete the metric, or consider combining it with the Developed Area metric. I recommend deleting it. Author Response: Non-concur. The metric is a proxy for many ecological effects of shoreline armoring and human development intensity. Armored shorelines can disconnect migratory paths for animals, inhibit marsh migration, and serve as an indirect metric of other issues like stormwater input. As the reviewer describes, the metric would respond to changes in shoreline based measures like seawalls, but it also serves as a general metric of current condition. The metric is designed as a continuous variable (rather than the categorical bar chart recommended) to avoid unsupported thresholds in model behavior (i.e., a sudden drop in suitability from 101 m to 100 m). Comment 2.12: 4.4.1 Hard Bottom Habitats - Here, we use a historical map of oyster reef extent as a proxy for hard bottom with the assumption that hard substrate is relatively immobile and these locations would likely have higher potential for oyster reestablishment. Revisit the assumption of hard bottom habitat mapping and oysters as a proxy for condition. Basis: It doesnt seem like a good idea to use oysters, which are not presently occupying the site to assess the quality of the habitat. I assume there is hard bottom distributed through the estuaries where this will be applied. By applying the salinity requirements for oysters, the model will reduce the value of some hard bottom habitats for a species thats not even there. Its also unlikely to be affected by the project alternatives. Its hard to imagine one of the alternatives seriously affecting hard bottom habitat in a way you could measure and consider the ultimate effects in this model. How can hard bottom be a factor in evaluating hard bottom? Isnt that a mapping factor? Interspersion is usually considered a good thing for habitat quality. Reducing the quality rating of the habitat because it has other habitats interspersed doesnt seem to be supported scientifically. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: I suggest dropping this metric unless the model is applied to sites with a lot of oyster habitat. Author Response: Non-concur. Oyster reefs and hard bottom habitats are an important part of the New York Bight ecosystem, particularly in the New Jersey Back Bays. The reviewer correctly notes the circular logic of delineating the ecosystem based on substrate and using substrate in assessment of ecosystem quality. However, substrate data are limited, and distinguishing these two parallel data sets was not possible for this region. The oyster model was adapted from a prior model and the cultch variable was left in this formulation to avoid confusion with other versions. Notably, the cultch variable was assessed with a binary input for hard bottom, which leads to a suitability of one for all hard bottoms relative to the cultch metric. Comment 2.13: 4.4.2.1 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Module - Having the SAV Fine Substrate curve go down to 0.0 SI for 100% fine sediment composition doesnt seem appropriate. - Basis: See above. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: The documentation should provide additional information to support this formula. - Author Response: Concur. The model was modified to reflect a suitability index of 0.1 when fines equal 100%, and text was edited accordingly. Comment 2.14: 4.4.2.1 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Module - New York State does not have an official standard for Secchi depth, but the state Department of Health requires 1.22 meters (4 feet) of clarity to locate a swimming beach (Lake George Association 2022). This general target aligns with ranges of observations of Secchi depth for the region (DEP 2017). The documentation should provide justification for applying swimming beach water quality to that needed to maintain eelgrass. - Basis: The whole section on light seems to need more justification. It doesnt wrap back to a link between the final criteria and eelgrass requirements. The Ecology of Eelgrass Meadows of the Atlantic Coast: A Community Profile has a graph that appears to show optimum PAR and indicates that there are upper limits to suitable levels of PAR for eelgrass that dont match the NYBEM graph. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Revisit and revise suitability curves for light. - Author Response: Concur. The logic of the light suitability index was further clarified with a particular emphasis on secchi targets. We specifically highlighted the need to revisit the secchi depth used to estimate Kd. Notably, an upper limit to light exposure was not included in the models in the interest of parsimony and to preserve the emphasis on the more likely condition where lack of limit is a limiting factor. Comment 2.15: 4.4.2.1 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Module - Using vessel traffic as a proxy for human disturbance is not sufficiently justified in the documentation. - Basis: There are many instances of federal channels with eelgrass adjacent to and within the channel. Also, I dont see where the project alternatives will affect vessel traffic  except in the extreme case with sea level rise where the barrier is closed permanently. I recommend deleting this metric. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Revisit model justification for vessel density. - Author Response: Concur. The justification for vessel traffic was insufficient and has been clarified. Comment 2.16: 4.4.2.1 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Module - Reexamine the overarching index equation for SAV. - Basis: If the fine substrate and percent light metrics are correct and sustained, the relationship should be the lowest of substrate.sav or light, rather than adding and dividing by the number of parameters as they would be requirements. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Examine equation and add justification accordingly. - Author Response: Non-concur. The reviewer is proposing that the equation should reflect limiting factors for SAV growth. The NYBEM is not intended to reflect a particular taxa, and the index equation intends to capture a general condition index for this system. Comment 2.17: 4.4.2.2 Hard Clam Module  Its unclear if the NYBEM applies the entire Hard Clam Model. - Basis: The documentation should indicate whether that is the case. (I didnt see the Thompson reference in the References section. Its hard to envision how the team will have enough data to determine the salinity at any particular site, but if thats possible, its fine. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Clarify use of Thompson et al. - Author Response: Concur. The partial use of this model was clarified in the text. Comment 2.18: 4.4.2.2 Hard Clam Module  This statement doesnt appear to match the graph or the formula: Similar to seagrass and oysters, substrate is a critical parameter for hard clam viability. Optimal substrate is shelly soft bottom. As the substrate composition increases in sand and/or mud, the substrate is less suitable for clams. - Basis: The graph says 100% sand gets the highest SI.. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Resolve discrepancy. - Author Response: Concur. The suitability curve was incorrect, and the model was modified to better reflect response of hard clam to fine sediment composition. Comment 2.19: 4.4.2.2 Hard Clam Module  The way the soft bottom sub-model is structured, it seems like large areas of the estuaries wont have a habitat quality rating  maybe thats ok. - Basis: See above. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Address habitat coverage. - Author Response: Non-concur. All areas in the estuary receive a habitat suitability index. The estuarine subtidal covers all hard and soft bottom habitats based on hard bottom presence-absence. Comment 2.20: 4.4.2.2 Hard Clam Module  As a proxy for seagrass coverage, we use the index of seagrass suitability (Iclam). You cant really do this. There are huge areas that look like they could support eelgrass, but dont. - Basis: See above. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: None. - Author Response: Non-concur. The connection between the seagrass and hard clam models follows the logic of Thompson et al.Â (2021). Given a lack of comprehensive seagrass mapping in the region, we use the seagrass habitat suitability as a proxy. The text has been clarified to emphasize this use of a proxy. Comment 2.21: 4.5.1 Beach Slope  Remove irrelevant references. - Basis: Seabeach amaranth doesnt grow in the marine intertidal zone. This also seems to include a model for southeast Florida. Need to indicate how alternatives would affect beach slope. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Remove inappropriate citations. - Author Response: Concur. Seabeach amaranth and sea turtle models were initiatilly included as examples of model structure for this system. Text was edited accordingly. Comment 2.22: 4.5.2 Exposure Duration  Revise suitability curve to better reflect ecological importance. - Basis: The graph doesnt appear to be ecologically supported. The areas below the midpoint would be just as valuable as the midpoint, if not more valuable because it is likely to contain more benthic organisms even if its not available as long. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Edit suitability curve. - Author Response: Concur. The range of optimal suitability was expanded to trel from 0.25-0.75.

See also response to Comments 1.4 and 2.10. Comment 2.24: 4.5.4 Vegetation Cover  Remove variable from model. - Basis: There shouldnt be any vegetation (other than algae and maybe extremely rare eelgrass) in the marine intertidal zone. The tern reference applies to beaches, not intertidal. - Significance: High. - Recommended Resolution: Remove variable from model. - Author Response: Concur. See also response Comment 1.10.

Models were modified according to Comments 1.11 and 1.12, and text was edited for clarity and rationale was bolstered. Comment 2.27: 4.7 Marine, Deepwater Zone - Suitability curves need additional justification * Basis: See above. * Significance: High. * Recommended Resolution: None. * Author Response: Concur. Models were modified according to Comment 1.13, and text was edited for clarity and rationale was bolstered. C.3 Reviewer-3 Comment 3.1: All functions within the nybem R package should have proper documentation, sample data, and provide a basic example of its functionality. Basis: This is a basic requirement for publishing open source/public R packages to ensure the package and its functions are comprehensible and usable to all users. Additionally, this can help users navigate their own technical challenges by providing a working example with appropriate syntax. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: Create a vignette with working example(s) for each major nybem function, using sample data embedded into the package itself. For these basic examples, users should not be expected to pull data from other sources (R packages, repos, websites, etc.). Author Response: Concur. All functions are written to include standard format and help documentation. Test data and a testing record are included within the tests folder of the package. Comment 3.2: SIcalc code and documentation. Basis: The approx. function used in the SIcalc function seems to appropriately interpolate between the SI break points, but this might be initially difficult for users to determine since it is presented quite differently in the documentation vs.Â the R package/vignette. Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: Be explicit in documentation on which set of input variables are defined for each model. For example, nybem_submodels$NYBEM.mar.int documentation shows that exp dur with a range of 0-1 is expected, but trel, with a range of 0-100 used. This is not the same documentation as land.use which has urban.per as input. Just need to be clear and constant about how to interpret these models and what are actually user inputs. Author Response: Concur. Documentation was revised to reflect the correct variable naming as indicated. Comment 3.3: Calling variables in SIcalc. Basis: The nybem submodels require users to specify the input variables in the right order. It might be more appropriate for the function to look for the names of each variable not the index location. Example below: #obs_1 &lt;- list(beach.slope, exp.dur, land.use, shoreline, veg.cover) #SIcalc(SI = nybem_submodels$NYBEM.mar.int, input_proj = obs_1) #!= #obs_1 &lt;- list(beach.slope, exp.dur, land.use, veg.cover, shoreline) #SIcalc(SI = nybem_submodels$NYBEM.mar.int, input_proj = obs_1) Significance: High. Recommended Resolution: This might be a bit picky but I really think it is important to choice between a linear model look up table or interpolating between breakpoints. Just be clear and consistent throughout all documentation. Author Response: Non-concur. The reviewer makes an excellent point about calling variables directly. However, the nybem code was written to mirror variable structure from an existing package (ecorest). Variable calls were double-checked to ensure consistency in look-up referencing. C.4 Reviewer-4 Comment 4.1: Given the potential phased approach for these studies and the model, we need to make sure we have a good method for tracking the model and model documentation version(s). Basis: We need to avoid a situation where potential model users, reviewers, etc. are unclear on what version of the model is being used and whether or not that version is certified. Significance: Medium  potential inadvertent use of uncertified model. Recommended Resolution: As discussed during our mid-review webex, recommend clear communication in the model documentation of the model version, certification status, any changes made since certification, etc. Also agree with the recommendation of using the CRAN website for version tracking of the R software package(s). Author Response: Concur. Following review, the certified version of the model will be uploaded to CRAN, and the associated documentation will be peer-reviewed and published as an ERDC technical report. The model code and documents will be clearly labeled as version 1.0.0, and any subsequent revisions will be identified from new version numbering. Web-based model documents will be labeled and linked accordingly. Comment 4.2: Section 4.4.2.2 indicates that optimal clam substrate is shelly soft bottom and as the substrate composition increases in sand and/or mud, the substrate is less suitable for clams. This is contradicted by the HSI curve which indicates increasing suitability as sand composition increases. Basis: Contradiction in description of metric vs.Â HSI curve and formulas. Significance: Low. Recommended Resolution: Recommend either modifying text to comport with HSI curve and formulas or vice versa. Author Response: Concur. Text and figures were aligned.
