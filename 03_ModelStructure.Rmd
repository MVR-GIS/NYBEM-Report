## Conceptual Model

Conceptual ecological models are required for all USACE ecosystem restoration projects due to their utility to increase understanding, identify potential alternatives, and facilitate team dialog (Fischenich 2008, USACE 2011). These same benefits apply for assessing environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions. Additionally, conceptual models also inform and structure the development of quantitative ecological models (Grant and Swannack 2008, Swannack et al. 2012) such as the NYBEM. Conceptual models of the New York Bight were iteratively developed through the mediated workshops described above. Workshop ideas and content were synthesized with available literature, conceptual models of similar ecosystems (e.g., wetland function in Coastal Louisiana; e.g., Twilley 2004), and existing regional conceptual models (e.g., Montagna et al. 2013). A seven step conceptual model development process was iteratively applied as workshops proceeded (Fischenich 2008; Table 2).

Ultimately, multiple conceptual models were developed of the New York Bight with different purposes. We first developed an overarching conceptual model communicating how a mosaic of regional ecosystems function together at a system-scale, which is intended for broad use including both technical and non-technical audiences (Figure 3). Three overarching systems were identified to frame model development: (1) nearshore/marine ecosystems, (2) estuarine ecosystems, and (3) system connectivity between multiple ecosystem types. These systems were distinguished based on differences in ecosystem processes such as wave energy and surge exposure, likely effects of proposed management alternatives, and potential differences in modeling philosophy (e.g., habitat models for nearshore and estuarine systems and a network approach to connectivity). Cumulatively, these three categories provide a means of assessing nearshore and estuarine ecosystems at a patch-scale as well as a means of assessing system-scale outcomes associated with connectivity. The ecosystem types were adopted from a combination of two existing classifications (Cowardin et al. 1979, USFWS 1997). In addition to this overarching model, mechanistic models are being developed for each ecosystem type to guide quantitative model development (see Quantification section below), which are intended for technical audiences focused on the scientific details of ecological assessments.

## Habitat-Style Modeling Approach

Dozens of ecological modeling tools focus on coastal ecosystems. These models vary based on factors such as the disciplinary perspective (e.g., hydrologic, geomorphic, ecological), the level of ecological hierarchy addressed (e.g., individuals, populations, communities, ecosystems), the basic approach to modeling (e.g., statistical, theoretical), input requirements (e.g., few parameters vs. extensive geospatial layers), the treatment of time and space (e.g., lumped vs. distributed), and the degree of development (e.g., long history vs. ad hoc). However, multiple gaps in these these tools are the driving motivation for developing the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM). 

* *Comprehensive view of regional ecosystems*: Many existing ecological models focus on a subset of regional ecosystems (e.g., estuarine subtidal, but not marine subtidal) or focal taxa (e.g., fish, but not seagrass). The large spatial scope of the USACE studies requires seamless landscape coverage of the study areas as well as a consistent approach for assessing multiple ecosystem types simultaneously.  
* *Connection to USACE management actions*: Existing tools often emphasize important physical forcings on ecosystems without a direct connection to USACE's proposed project action. For instance, a model may include marsh response to sea level rise, but be unable to incorporate marsh response to sea level rise in the presence of a storm surge barrier.  
* *Indirect effects*: Models often emphasize direct changes at a site-scale rather than indirect effects of off-site change. For instance, a model may assess habitat quality associated substrate, but be unable to link to changes in substrate as a result of distant infrastructure (e.g., a storm surge barrier).  
* *System-wide data*: Many valuable ecological tools have been developed at small spatial scales based on detailed site data (e.g., vegetation surveys). However, the extremely large scale of these projects precludes field data collection, and NYBEM inputs must be available for the entire model extent.  
* *Rapid and phased application*: The USACE studies are assessing project outcomes on aggresive schedules, and some tools that might be applicable on longer time horizons are not feasible in these short periods. Additionally, the projects require an evolving set of tools that mirror the needs of a tiered NEPA assessment.


Given these challenges, the NYBEM seeks to build from the wide breadth of existing knowledge and models to develop a comprehensive set of tools directly applicable to the unique needs of planning USACE coastal storm risk management projects. The NYBEM will draw from two distinct modeling approaches applicable at different scales. First, six patch-scale models will be developed, which use an index-based modeling philosophy assessing the quantity and quality of a given ecosystem type. Second, system-scale models will be proposed, which apply network-analytic methods to assess organismal connectivity. The following sections describe preliminary versions of the patch-scale models and plans for future model development after the release of the NJBB Draft Feasibility Report.


This model takes a common approach to ecological modeling based on quantity and quality of habitat. “Index” models (Swannack et al. 2012) were originally developed for species-specific habitat applications (e.g., slider turtles), but the general approach has also been adapted to guilds (e.g., salmonids), communities (e.g., floodplain vegetation), and ecosystem processes (e.g., the Hydrogeomorphic Method). An index-based modeling approach is used for multiple reasons. First, index models directly respond to changes in physical properties and provide a clear link to changes in ecosystem quantity and quality resulting from future conditions with and without proposed actions. Second, index-based models align well with a phased model development approach. For instance, an initial model could use three critical variables influencing habitat quality, and future model versions could include more variables as data becomes available. Third, index-based models are familiar to USACE decision-makers from diverse applications in other regions such as Louisiana coastal restoration (i.e., the Wetland Value Assessment), California bay restoration (i.e., East San Pedro Bay), and gulf cost harbor expansion (i.e., Mobile Bay). Notably, these examples each assess multiple habitat types (e.g., oyster, seagrass) and aggregate outcomes into an overall metric of ecological impacts or benefits.


Index models are developed for each of six major ecosystem types (Table 3). These ecosystems are defined from a combined classification based on Cowardin et al. (1979) and USFWS (1997). Salinity and tidal range differentiate these ecosystems, both of which can change under futures with and without agency projects. Other analyses have developed ecosystem-scale assessments and models based on similar or more refined divisions in physical properties (e.g., Clough et al. 2016, Fischbach et al. 2018), and the current criteria represent a compromise between the need for detailed assessment of the type and location of infrastructure impacts and the need for a readily implementable rule set applicable at the broad spatial scale of the NYBEM.  


```{r}
#Create empty table
Table3 <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 4))
colnames(Table3) <- c("Tidal Limits", "Marine (Salinity >= 30ppt)", "Estuarine (Salinity = 0.5 to 30ppt)", "Freshwater (Salinity <= 0.5ppt)")

#Specify rows of the table
Table3[1,] <- c("Deepwater (-2m to -20m)", "Marine, Deep", "Estuarine, Subtidal", "Freshwater")
Table3[2,] <- c("Subtidal (MLLW to -2m)", "Marine, Subtitdal", "Estuarine, Subtidal", "Freshwater")
Table3[3,] <- c("Intertidal (MHHW to MLLW)", "Marine, Intertidal", "Estuarine, Intertidal", "Freshwater")

#Send output table
rownames(Table3) <- NULL
knitr::kable(Table3, caption="Table 3. Definition of NYBEM ecosystem types.") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```


In NYBEM, the quantity and quality of each ecosystem type may be assessed separately. For instance, ecosystems could be rapidly delineated from empirical data for the existing condition (e.g., field or tide gauge) or modeled hydrodynamic data for future conditions or proposed management actions. These delineated ecosystems can be summarized as an overarching habitat quantity in acres. Ecosystem quality may then be assessed based on patch-specific data and known thresholds in ecological response (e.g., on a normalized 0 to 1 scale indicating ecological quality or function). The product of habitat quality and quantity provides a consistent metric across ecosystem types (i.e., “habitat units”). Here, the terms "habitat" and "ecosystem" are used synonymously to indicate a given patch.
