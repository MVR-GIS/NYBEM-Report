\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is conducting three large-scale coastal storm risk management feasibility studies in the New York Bight ecosystem, specifically: the New Jersey Back Bays, the New York-New Jersey Harbor \& Tributaries Study, and the Nassau County Back Bays. In these study areas, the USACE is considering a diversity of measures for mitigating flood risks, including: structural actions (e.g., levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers), non-structural measures (e.g., buy-outs, elevation of structures, flood-proofing), and natural and nature-based features (e.g., wetland creation, reefs for breakwaters). Environmental outcomes and acceptability are important constraints on plan selection, and the studies are applying a ``tiered'' approach to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM) is being developed as a tool for partially assessing the direct and indirect effects of agency actions on regional ecosystems. The NYBEM currently assesses changes in habitat quantity associated with changing hydrodynamics, although future versions will include assessment of habitat quality and changes in aquatic connectivity. This report documents ecological model development processes to date, including information on model scoping, the development process, conceptualization, quantification, and evaluation. The NYBEM is then applied to the New Jersey Back Bays study to assess the extent of potential changes in habitat quantity associated with six alignments of inlet and bay closure structures. The direct, ``footprint'' effects of this infrastructure range from 71 to 182 acres of aquatic ecosystems. The indirect, ``offsite'' effects of this infrastructure lead to habitat switching from estuarine-intertidal and freshwater ecosystems to estuarine-subtidal and upland ecosystems. The magnitude of switching varies based on the six alternative alignments from 418 ac to as much as 938 acres. These estimates do not currently incorporate changes in habitat quality, but instead only account for tidal ranges and salinity thresholds.

\chapter{Background}\label{background}}

In response to Superstorm Sandy and associated Congressional directives (\href{https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ2/PLAW-113publ2.pdf}{PL 113-2}), the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (\href{https://www.nad.usace.army.mil/CompStudy/}{NACCS}) identified nine focus areas with populations vulnerable to coastal flooding risk. Three of these areas are in the New York Bight ecosystem, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is conducting three large-scale coastal storm risk management (CSRM) feasibility studies. The New Jersey Back Bays (\href{https://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/New-Jersey-Back-Bays-Coastal-Storm-Risk-Management/}{NJBB}) study is investigating 900 mi\textsuperscript{2} of land and water areas along with 3,400 mi of shoreline spanning a significant portion of New Jersey's Atlantic coastline. The New York-New Jersey Harbor \& Tributaries Study (\href{https://www.nan.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Projects-in-New-York/New-York-New-Jersey-Harbor-Tributaries-Focus-Area-Feasibility-Study/}{HATS}) is examining 2,100 mi\textsuperscript{2} and comprises parts of 25 counties in the two states. The Nassau County Back Bays (\href{https://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Nassau-County-Back-Bays-Study/}{NCBB}) study is investigating flood risk in 400 mi\textsuperscript{2} of land and water areas on Long Island's southern shore. Objectives of these studies include issues such as: (a) reduction of coastal storm damage risks to communities, public infrastructure, important societal resources, and the environment, (b) improvement of a community's ability to recover from storm surge damages, (c) enhancement of human health and safety by improving performance of critical infrastructure and natural features during and after storm surge events, and (d) enhancement of coastal resilience with nature-based features.

\end{figure}

In these study areas, the USACE is considering a diversity of measures for mitigating flood risks, including: structural actions (e.g., levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers), non-structural measures (e.g., buy-outs, elevation of structures, flood-proofing), and natural and nature-based features (NNBF, e.g., wetland creation, reefs for breakwaters). Environmental outcomes and acceptability are important constraints on plan selection, and recommended plans must be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Given the large spatial scope, these USACE studies are applying a ``tiered'' approach to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Tiered assessment intends to provide appropriate data at key planning milestones for complex studies with diverse environmental effects. In the context of these studies, a ``Tier 1'' Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be generated at the conclusion of the USACE Planning Process (i.e., in the Feasibility Report and Chief's Report). A ``Tier 2'' EIS will be developed in Pre-Construction Engineering and Design (PED). The ``Tier 1'' EIS is being developed with sequentially more accurate and precise information as the planning process proceed through key milestones such as the Alternatives Milestone Meeting (AMM), Tentatively Selected Plan Milestone (TSP), and Agency Decision Milestone (ADM).

\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}}

The conceptual and numerical models presented here seek to articulate and quantify mechanisms of environmental impact of proposed coastal storm risk management alternatives. The following goals guided model development:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Models should provide a general description of the \emph{relative} environmental effects of large-scale alternatives, which can inform the feasibility process and NEPA assessments.
\item
  Models must be able to forecast environmental effects over the project planning horizon (50-100 years) based on physical changes to ecosystems resulting from both background processes (e.g., sea level rise) and project alternatives (e.g., change in tidal regime from storm surge barriers).
\item
  Models should assess environmental effects by ecosystem type (e.g., marine deepwater vs.~estuarine intertidal) to inform mitigation actions.
\item
  Models should capture direct effects of actions at infrastructure locations (e.g., the footprint of a floodwall) as well as indirect effects induced off-site from infrastructure (e.g., change in back bay hydrodynamics associated with a storm surge barrier).
\item
  Models should be adaptable to new information and data as project planning proceeds.
\item
  Models should provide a consistent approach for environmental assessment, which can assist with communication of cumulative effects of recommended alternatives across the region.
\end{itemize}

\section{Report Overview}\label{report-overview}}

This report presents development and application of the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM, ``nigh-bem''), which will ultimately consist of two primary sub-models. First, an index-based modeling framework (i.e., a habitat-suitability-style, quantity-quality approach) is applied to assess patch-scale effects for six ecosystem types (e.g., estuarine intertidal zones). Second, a network-based model will be used to assess system-wide connectivity for migratory, aquatic organisms (e.g., anadramous fish). This report provides documentation of the technical details, use, and relevant information for USACE model certification (EC 1105-2-412, PB 2013-02). The following sections summarize the major elements of model development:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Model Development Process}: Summarizes the general approach for modeling and the scope of the model.
\item
  \emph{Conceptualization}: Describes the overarching view of the structure and function of ecosystems in the New York Bight.
\item
  \emph{Quantification}: Reviews the technical details of the models.
\item
  \emph{Evaluation}: Assesses the models relative to underlying numerical accuracy, scientific theory, and usability.
\item
  \emph{Application and Communication}: Describes application of models and communication of outcomes for the existing condition in the New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB).
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Model Development Process}\label{model-development-process}}

When used in the context of complex management decisions with many partners, environmental and ecological modeling often benefit from approaches that emphasize transparency, increase user input during development, and clearly communicate model assumptions and limitations (van den Belt 2004, Voinov and Bousquet 2010, Herman et al.~2019). Here, a general five-step modeling process is followed that applies best practices in ecological model development (Grant and Swannack 2008). First, general relationships among essential ecosystem components are formally \emph{conceptualized} to tell the story of ``how the system works'' (Fischenich 2008). Second, the model is \emph{quantified} using a formal structure of functional relationships, algorithms, and parameters. Third, models are \emph{evaluated} relative to underlying scientific theory, numerical accuracy, and usability, which often entails techniques such as code checking, testing, verification, and sensitivity analyses. Fourth, a model is \emph{applied} to a given management question, scenario, or assessment. Fifth, a strategy is developed and executed to \emph{communicate} model development and application to technical and non-technical audiences. This process has been applied numerous times to select, adapt, or develop ecological models for USACE and non-USACE studies (e.g., McKay et al.~2019; Herman et al.~2019), and the framework is intended to draw heavily from existing knowledge, data, and tools.

USACE policy (EC-1105-2-412) defines a model as ``a representation of a system for a purpose,'' and thus, specifying a modeling objective is often a foundational step in the modeling process. \textbf{Here, our modeling objective is to articulate the mechanisms and magnitude of environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions in the New York Bight Ecosystem}. However, this model (like all models) is being developed in a constrained environment with limited time and resources. Three key issues constrained and guided NYBEM development, each of which is addressed in subsequent sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The model domain is limited to the spatial extent of the focal USACE studies.
\item
  Model development is phased to align with USACE project planning milestones.
\item
  Transparency in model development and input from stakeholders and partners were actively embraced to increase the adoption and acceptance of the tools, given the high-profile nature of the studies.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{spatial-extent}{%
\section{Spatial Extent}\label{spatial-extent}}

The cumulative project area of the ongoing CSRM studies exceeds 3,000 mi\textsuperscript{2} and covers multiple states. The spatial extent of model application was defined by a sequence of four sequentially smaller filters (Figure 2):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{New York Bight}: The USFWS (1997) defines the ecosystems of the New York Bight as the ``open ocean region south of Long Island and east of New Jersey, known as the New York Bight proper'' and all associated upstream estuaries, waters, and lands. This large spatial domain covers 31,276 mi\textsuperscript{2} (10,206 mi\textsuperscript{2} upland watershed and 21,070 mi\textsuperscript{2} estuarine or marine). Specifically, the watershed is defined based on ten 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watersheds (02020006, 02020007, 02020008, 02030101, 02030103, 02030104, 02030105, 02030202, 02040301, and 02040302). The USFWS Bight definition includes all marine ecosystems offshore. However, given the nearshore scope of USACE's studies, seaward extent is limited to ecosystems above a 20m depth contour (i.e., the USFWS definition of ``nearshore''). This watershed boundary and seaward limit have a total area of 13,420 mi\textsuperscript{2}.
\item
  \emph{Project Boundaries}: The Bight ecosystem includes many upland and coastal ecosystems beyond the project boundaries (e.g., Eastern Long Island). The USACE study boundaries provide a second filter on the spatial limits of the NYBEM. The New York Bight ecosystem contained within the project boundaries has an area of 2,930 mi\textsuperscript{2}.
\item
  \emph{Undeveloped Areas}: USACE projects are required to account and mitigate for detrimental environmental effects associated with any recommended actions. However, the region is highly developed, and USACE should not be penalized for existing ecological impacts. As such, developed areas are removed from the domain as these represent impacts not attributable to USACE projects. Developed areas were assessed via the 2016 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) as open space, low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity classes (Codes 21, 22, 23, and 24). The reduced model domain is 1,720 mi\textsuperscript{2}, which includes all areas potentially assessed for impacts.
\item
  \emph{Aquatic Ecosystems}: A key focus of the NYBEM is assessment of indirect effects of proposed actions. Currently, upland and shoreline ecosystems above mean higher high water (MHHW) are not included in the models. Impact assessments from these systems (e.g., dunes, scrub-shrub, riparian zones) are better understood from prior impact analyses. Additionally, these systems are likely to experience fewer indirect impacts, and methods are generally available for assessing direct impacts. Upland ecosystems are not explicitly removed from the spatial domain at this phase, but are removed below through the absence of any patch-scale models at elevations above MHHW.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ZZ_Fig02_NYBEM.Extent.jpeg}
\caption{\emph{Figure 2. NYBEM model domain: (left) Components of model domain, (right) NYBEM domain.}}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{phased-approach}{%
\section{Phased Approach}\label{phased-approach}}

USACE planning studies sequentially make decisions about potential actions and buy-down risk and uncertainty to inform the next level of decision and narrow in on a recommended alternative. Furthermore, the USACE studies have proposed a ``tiered'' NEPA assessment, which is designed to gather more data and refine outcomes as a project proceeds. The NYBEM toolkit must be capable of responding to evolving project planning needs and data availability as these studies develop. As such, model development is explicitly being conducted in ``phases,'' and NYBEM tools and methods will evolve alongside project planning. In each phase, development will proceed iteratively through the cycle described above of conceptualization, quantification, evaluation, application, and communication. Table 1 presents key aspects of this phased approach to development.

Importantly, a phased development approach applies the best available information at the moment of application. However, this inherently leads to ``interim'' or ``draft'' models that are sequentially applied, reviewed, and improved. In this report, Phase 1 of model development is documented, while presenting the planned path forward for future phases. Development plans are subject to change.

\section{Mediated Modeling}\label{mediated-modeling}}

The NYBEM intends to assess ecological consequences of alternative infrastructure options in a large, diverse ecosystem. There are many types of stakeholder-based model development processes that overlap in approach and emphasize collaboration: Model Prototyping, Participatory Modeling, Group Model Building, Companion Modeling and Mediated Model Development (See reviews by Voinov and Bousquet 2010, Gray et al.~2017, and Hall et al.~2019). These processes are generally well-suited to environmental management problems that are politically and publicly-sensitive, complex, and engage diverse audiences (van den Belt et al.~2006). ``Mediated modeling'' is used here to describe the family of techniques for building consensus among multiple partners and producing credible and defensible ecological models in a transparent way (van den Belt 2004).
For NYBEM, a suite of workshop-based model development methods are adapted from Herman et al.~(2019). These workshops utilize a lecture-exercise format, where participants are led through the theory of a particular aspect of modeling (e.g., conceptual modeling) and then apply said theory to a focal ecosystem (i.e., the New York Bight). A series of workshops and reviews are structuring the iterative development of NYBEM with subsequent research and synthesis between meetings (See McKay et al.~2021 for additional detail). Appendix B summarizes workshop logistics and focal topics. Key milestones in model development are briefly described below, but the overarching strategy is to engage larger audiences and more formal forms of model evaluation as the toolkit develops.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Preliminary workshop with Philadelphia District} (January 2019): A preliminary conceptual model was developed with USACE Philadelphia District team members, which focused generally on issues potentially relevant for environment compliance at the broadest level.
\item
  \emph{USACE workshop with Philadelphia and New York Districts} (March 2019): A joint team from multiple USACE Districts was convened, and a strategy was proposed to develop NYBEM around key ecosystem types to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the modeling problem and structure the path forward for model development.
\item
  \emph{Interagency conceptual modeling workshop} (June 2019): Fifty scientists and environmental managers (from federal, state, and local government as well as select non-profit organizations and academic units) were brought together to focus on the development of conceptual models supporting the NYBEM. This workshop utilized a series of ``posters'' for attendees to provide input on relevant variables and processes for each ecosystem type.
\item
  \emph{Interagency numerical modeling workshop} (November 2019): A subset of attendees (20+) from the June 2019 workshop reconvened to discuss findings from the prior workshops. Prior to this meeting, the ``posters'' from June were formalized and synthesized with available scientific literature. At this meeting, attendees were able to review and revise preliminary versions of the model structure.
\item
  \emph{Phase-1 model documentation} (March 2022; this report): This report provides model development status as of the NJBB Draft Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement.
\item
  \emph{Phase-2 development and application} (Summer 2022): Habitat quality and system connectivity tools will be further developed following the release of the Draft NJBB Feasibility Report. USACE requires assessment and external evaluation of ecological models used in Feasibility-level planning decisions (i.e., model certification), and this report will be modified as models are further developed and applied.
\end{itemize}

Rapid timelines and iterative development encourage a transparent approach for model documentation. We adopt a growing family of methods for ``\href{https://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/}{reproducible research},'' which embrace code and data sharing, enable review processes, and facilitate use of methods and results. Specifically, \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/}{R Markdown} is applied to development and document models, which are coded in the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{R Statistical Software}. These tools minimize data transfer errors and facilitate internal inspect of code as it is developed.

\section{Conceptual Model}\label{conceptual-model}}

Conceptual ecological models are required for all USACE ecosystem restoration projects due to their utility to increase understanding, identify potential alternatives, and facilitate team dialog (Fischenich 2008, USACE 2011). These same benefits apply for assessing environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions. Additionally, conceptual models also inform and structure the development of quantitative ecological models (Grant and Swannack 2008, Swannack et al.~2012) such as the NYBEM. Conceptual models of the New York Bight were iteratively developed through the mediated workshops described above. Workshop ideas and content were synthesized with available literature, conceptual models of similar ecosystems (e.g., wetland function in Coastal Louisiana; e.g., Twilley 2004), and existing regional conceptual models (e.g., Montagna et al.~2013). A seven step conceptual model development process was iteratively applied as workshops proceeded (Fischenich 2008; Table 2).

Step & NYBEM Application\\
\hline
1. State the model objectives. & Our numerical modeling objective is to articulate the mechanisms and magnitude of environmental effects of proposed coastal storm risk management actions in the New York Bight Ecosystem. This conceptual model is intended to communicate the overarching scope of model development to a broad audience.\\
\hline
2. Bound the system of interest. & NYBEM is limited to the New York Bight Watershed with a seaward limit of a 20m depth contour. The models are further limited to aquatic ecosystems in the National Hydrography Dataset within the NJBB project area. The NYBEM focuses only on effects to regional ecosystem, and other forms of environmental impacts (e.g., air quality, historic preservation) are addressed elsewhere in NEPA documentation.\\
\hline
3. Identify critical model components within the system. & This overarching conceptual model focuses on key ecosystem types and system-wide connectivity. Patch-scale models are defined from a combined classification based on Cowardin et al. (1979), USFWS (1997), and Montagna et al. (2013). A series of workshops and literature search will be used to identify ecosystem-specific model components associated with habitat quality.\\
\hline
4. Articulate relationships among model components. & Only ecosystem types are presented, given the communication-driven purpose of this overarching model. More mechanistic conceptual models are being developed for each ecosystem type, which show connections between drivers and stressors, ecosystem states, and ecological outcomes.\\
\hline
5. Represent the conceptual model. & A simple graphic representation of the conceptual model (Figure 3) was developed to facilitate communication between project team members, sponsors, partner agencies, and other interested parties.\\
\hline
6. Describe the expected pattern of behavior. & The team qualitatively assessed the model along with potential gaps in ecosystem types and environmental impacts.\\
\hline
7. Test, review, and revise. & This overarching conceptual model was developed, presented, and refined based on a series of modeling workshops (Appendix B).\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Ultimately, multiple conceptual models were developed of the New York Bight with different purposes. We first developed an overarching conceptual model communicating how a mosaic of regional ecosystems function together at a system-scale, which is intended for broad use including both technical and non-technical audiences (Figure 3). Three overarching systems were identified to frame model development: (1) nearshore/marine ecosystems, (2) estuarine ecosystems, and (3) system connectivity between multiple ecosystem types. These systems were distinguished based on differences in ecosystem processes such as wave energy and surge exposure, likely effects of proposed management alternatives, and potential differences in modeling philosophy (e.g., habitat models for nearshore and estuarine systems and a network approach to connectivity). Cumulatively, these three categories provide a means of assessing nearshore and estuarine ecosystems at a patch-scale as well as a means of assessing system-scale outcomes associated with connectivity. The ecosystem types were adopted from a combination of two existing classifications (Cowardin et al.~1979, USFWS 1997). In addition to this overarching model, mechanistic models are being developed for each ecosystem type to guide quantitative model development (see Quantification section below), which are intended for technical audiences focused on the scientific details of ecological assessments.

\section{Habitat-Style Modeling Approach}\label{habitat-style-modeling-approach}}

Dozens of ecological modeling tools focus on coastal ecosystems. These models vary based on factors such as the disciplinary perspective (e.g., hydrologic, geomorphic, ecological), the level of ecological hierarchy addressed (e.g., individuals, populations, communities, ecosystems), the basic approach to modeling (e.g., statistical, theoretical), input requirements (e.g., few parameters vs.~extensive geospatial layers), the treatment of time and space (e.g., lumped vs.~distributed), and the degree of development (e.g., long history vs.~ad hoc). However, multiple gaps in these these tools are the driving motivation for developing the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Comprehensive view of regional ecosystems}: Many existing ecological models focus on a subset of regional ecosystems (e.g., estuarine subtidal, but not marine subtidal) or focal taxa (e.g., fish, but not seagrass). The large spatial scope of the USACE studies requires seamless landscape coverage of the study areas as well as a consistent approach for assessing multiple ecosystem types simultaneously.\\
\item
  \emph{Connection to USACE management actions}: Existing tools often emphasize important physical forcings on ecosystems without a direct connection to USACE's proposed project action. For instance, a model may include marsh response to sea level rise, but be unable to incorporate marsh response to sea level rise in the presence of a storm surge barrier.\\
\item
  \emph{Indirect effects}: Models often emphasize direct changes at a site-scale rather than indirect effects of off-site change. For instance, a model may assess habitat quality associated substrate, but be unable to link to changes in substrate as a result of distant infrastructure (e.g., a storm surge barrier).\\
\item
  \emph{System-wide data}: Many valuable ecological tools have been developed at small spatial scales based on detailed site data (e.g., vegetation surveys). However, the extremely large scale of these projects precludes field data collection, and NYBEM inputs must be available for the entire model extent.\\
\item
  \emph{Rapid and phased application}: The USACE studies are assessing project outcomes on aggresive schedules, and some tools that might be applicable on longer time horizons are not feasible in these short periods. Additionally, the projects require an evolving set of tools that mirror the needs of a tiered NEPA assessment.
\end{itemize}

Given these challenges, the NYBEM seeks to build from the wide breadth of existing knowledge and models to develop a comprehensive set of tools directly applicable to the unique needs of planning USACE coastal storm risk management projects. The NYBEM will draw from two distinct modeling approaches applicable at different scales. First, six patch-scale models will be developed, which use an index-based modeling philosophy assessing the quantity and quality of a given ecosystem type. Second, system-scale models will be proposed, which apply network-analytic methods to assess organismal connectivity. The following sections describe preliminary versions of the patch-scale models and plans for future model development after the release of the NJBB Draft Feasibility Report.

This model takes a common approach to ecological modeling based on quantity and quality of habitat. ``Index'' models (Swannack et al.~2012) were originally developed for species-specific habitat applications (e.g., slider turtles), but the general approach has also been adapted to guilds (e.g., salmonids), communities (e.g., floodplain vegetation), and ecosystem processes (e.g., the Hydrogeomorphic Method). An index-based modeling approach is used for multiple reasons. First, index models directly respond to changes in physical properties and provide a clear link to changes in ecosystem quantity and quality resulting from future conditions with and without proposed actions. Second, index-based models align well with a phased model development approach. For instance, an initial model could use three critical variables influencing habitat quality, and future model versions could include more variables as data becomes available. Third, index-based models are familiar to USACE decision-makers from diverse applications in other regions such as Louisiana coastal restoration (i.e., the Wetland Value Assessment), California bay restoration (i.e., East San Pedro Bay), and gulf cost harbor expansion (i.e., Mobile Bay). Notably, these examples each assess multiple habitat types (e.g., oyster, seagrass) and aggregate outcomes into an overall metric of ecological impacts or benefits.

Index models are developed for each of six major ecosystem types (Table 3). These ecosystems are defined from a combined classification based on Cowardin et al.~(1979) and USFWS (1997). Salinity and tidal range differentiate these ecosystems, both of which can change under futures with and without agency projects. Other analyses have developed ecosystem-scale assessments and models based on similar or more refined divisions in physical properties (e.g., Clough et al.~2016, Fischbach et al.~2018), and the current criteria represent a compromise between the need for detailed assessment of the type and location of infrastructure impacts and the need for a readily implementable rule set applicable at the broad spatial scale of the NYBEM.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-5}Table 3. Definition of NYBEM ecosystem types.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l}
\hline
Tidal Limits & Marine (Salinity >= 30ppt) & Estuarine (Salinity = 0.5 to 30ppt) & Freshwater (Salinity <= 0.5ppt)\\
\hline
Deepwater (-2m to -20m) & Marine, Deep & Estuarine, Subtidal & Freshwater\\
\hline
Subtidal (MLLW to -2m) & Marine, Subtitdal & Estuarine, Subtidal & Freshwater\\
\hline
Intertidal (MHHW to MLLW) & Marine, Intertidal & Estuarine, Intertidal & Freshwater\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In NYBEM, the quantity and quality of each ecosystem type may be assessed separately. For instance, ecosystems could be rapidly delineated from empirical data for the existing condition (e.g., field or tide gauge) or modeled hydrodynamic data for future conditions or proposed management actions. These delineated ecosystems can be summarized as an overarching habitat quantity in acres. Ecosystem quality may then be assessed based on patch-specific data and known thresholds in ecological response (e.g., on a normalized 0 to 1 scale indicating ecological quality or function). The product of habitat quality and quantity provides a consistent metric across ecosystem types (i.e., ``habitat units''). Here, the terms ``habitat'' and ``ecosystem'' are used synonymously to indicate a given patch.

In NYBEM, the quantity and quality of each ecosystem type may be assessed separately. For instance, ecosystems could be rapidly delineated from empirical data for the existing condition (e.g., field or tide gauge) or modeled hydrodynamic data for future conditions or proposed management actions. These delineated ecosystems can be summarized as an overarching habitat quantity in acres.

The product of habitat quality and quantity provides a consistent metric across ecosystem types (i.e., ``habitat units''). Here, the terms ``habitat'' and ``ecosystem'' are used synonymously to indicate a given patch.

The criteria for delineating ecosystems (Table 3) were subsequently programmed as a suite of logic statements for identifying the salinity zone, tidal zone, or ecosystem / habitat type for any given patch. The following functions input salinity, bed elevation, mean lower low water (MLLW), and mean higher high water (MHHW) and output a numerical code indicating salinity, tidal, and habitat zone as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Tidal Zone}: 1 = deep, 2 = subtidal, 3 = intertidal, and 4 = upland
\item
  \emph{Salinity Zone}: 1 = marine, 2 = estuarine, or 3 = freshwater\\
\item
  \emph{Habitat Zone / Ecosystem Type}: 1 = upland, 2 = marine, deepwater, 3 = marine, subtidal, 4 = marine, intertidal, 5 = estuarine subtidal, 6 = estuarine intertidal, or 7 = freshwater

\chapter{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}}

Ecological models such as NYBEM, typically rely on multiple variables, ecological processes, and in many cases present a variety of ecological outcomes. As such, models can quickly become complex system representations with many components, inputs, assumptions, and modules. Model evaluation is the process for ensuring that numerical tools are scientifically defensible and transparently developed. Evaluation is often referred to as verification or validation, but it in fact includes a family of methods ranging from peer review to model testing to error checking (Schmolke et al.~2010). In this more general sense, evaluation should include the following (Grant and Swannack 2008): (1) assessing the reasonableness of model structure, (2) assessing functional relationships and verifying code, (3) evaluating model behavior relative to expected patterns, (4) comparing outcomes to empirical data, if possible, and (5) analyzing uncertainty in predictions. The USACE has established an ecological model certification process to ensure that planning models are sound and functional. These generally consist of evaluating tools relative to the three following categories: system quality, technical quality, and usability (EC 1105-2-412).

\hypertarget{system-quality}{%
\section{System Quality}\label{system-quality}}

Ecological models must not only maintain an appropriate theoretical and technical basis, but also must be computationally accurate (McKay et al.~2021b). System quality refers to the computational integrity of a model (or modeling system). For instance, is the tool appropriately programmed, has it been verified or stress-tested, and do outcomes behave in expected ways? NYBEM's system quality was evaluated in a variety of ways, including the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Code checking:} All code was error-checked during development by the primary programmer, and team members and interagency partners will be encouraged to inspect models as well. To date, quality assurance activities have included consistent variable naming, investigation of outputs from each individual line of code, and blocks of code (e.g., functions and loops).
\item
  \emph{Function Testing:} Spatial zonation functions were tested with 100 randomized input sets of salinity, bed elevation, MHHW, and MLLW (Table 4). All outputs produced the anticipated outcomes based on manual inspection of the data.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Table 4. Testing functions for habitat zonation.}

\hypertarget{technical-quality}{%
\section{Technical Quality}\label{technical-quality}}

The technical quality of a model is assessed relative to its reliance on contemporary theory, consistency with design objectives, and degree of documentation and testing. NYBEM is being developed with a variety of ecological modeling methods for analyzing coastal ecosystems. The patch-scale quantity/quality framework has been applied extensively to assess outcomes ranging from the species to ecosystem levels of hierarchy (e.g., habitat evaluation procedures and the hydrogeomorphic methods, respectively). Furthermore, each sub-model is being developed with existing models and supported by peer reviewed methods developed elsewhere. System-scale connectivity models will do the same as well. To date, technical quality has been informally assessed through multiple development workshops.

Future evaluations of technical quality will include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Habitat zones will be compared to existing condition habitat maps through the National Wetlands Inventory and analogous state data sets (e.g., submerged aquatic vegetation and shellfish data sets).
\item
  Informal review of model structure will continue with the interagency partners involved in development to date.
\item
  Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to evaluate the relative importance of variables.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{usability}{%
\section{Usability}\label{usability}}

The usability of a model can influence the repeatable and transparent application of a tool. This type of evaluation typically examines the ease of use, availability of inputs, transparency, error potential, and education of the user. As such, defining the intended user(s) is a crucial component of assessing usability. The NYBEM was developed for application by the USACE technical team of the NJBB and HATS studies. The tool is not currently intended for broader application by local sponsors, other regional teams, or by other USACE Districts. As such, there is currently no graphical user interface for the model beyond the script itself. To date, the primary mechanism for maintaining usability is development in Rmarkdown which allows for transparent sharing of code within model documentation.
Future evaluations of usability will include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open data sharing of all site-specific inputs and outputs for interrogation by internal and external partners.
\item
  Training of project team members on the use of NYBEM.
\item
  Archival and sharing of code with the ERDC ecological modeling team and the USACE Ecosystem Restoration Planning Center of Expertise.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Summary}\label{summary}}

This report has presented the development status for the New York Bight Ecological Model (NYBEM). The models are being developed in a transparent manner following a mediated modeling process (Herman et al.~2019). The phased development of these models is designed to incorporate information and data as they are developed. The models have been applied in the context of the New Jersey Back Bays (NJBB) coastal storm risk management study, and some preliminary observations are made regarding the relative effects of alternatives (Section 6 of this report).
As of this writing, the NYBEM only assesses habitat quantity, although future development will expand this scope. The following items represent key priorities for additional expansion of both the model and its application.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Habitat quality modules should be incorporated based on the workshop-based suitability index curves.
\item
  The system-wide connectivity model can be developed and executed, potentially to include multiple organisms or groups of organisms.
\item
  The models should be submitted and reviewed through the USACE Model Certification process.
\item
  Additional model evaluation should occur, including issues such as: verification of habitat assessment relative to field observations and sensitivity analysis of the underlying model structure.
\item
  Applications should be expanded to incorporate more tidal years (including storm periods), alternative operational closure scenarios, more sea level rise conditions, and other project-relevant factors.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{future-model-development}{%
\section{Future Model Development}\label{future-model-development}}

Currently, only habitat quantity is included in assessments. Model development is underway relative to habitat quality modules, system connectivity, and aggregation of quantity, quality, and connectivity into an overarching environmental effects index. These assessments will be included in the NJBB Final Feasibility Report.

\hypertarget{habitat-quality-modules}{%
\subsection{Habitat Quality Modules}\label{habitat-quality-modules}}

Ecosystem quality may be differentially assessed for each of the six habitat types shown in Table 3, which we refer to as sub-models or modules. An index-based model is being developed for each ecosystem based on existing data and models. A consistent set of methods was used to develop each sub-model. First, candidate variables were identified at workshops and augemented with taxa-specific habitat suitability models (i.e., ``blue books''), relevant tools (e.g., New England Marsh Model), and literature search. Second, system-wide data sets were compiled from national data layers, hydrodynamic models, and other data sources (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal, \href{https://portal.midatlanticocean.org/}{MARCO}). Third, potential variables were compiled and rationale was developed supporting the inclusion or exclusion of each. Fourth, an ecosystem-specific conceptual model was compiled to highlight key variables used in numerical model development. Fifth, ``suitability'' curves were developed for each variable based on existing suitability indices (e.g., from USFWS habitat models), published ecological thresholds/responses, and professional judgment / qualitative responses. These suitability curves represent the relative quality of a given patch on a 0 to 1 scale, where 0 is poor and 1 is ideal. Sixth, all suitability curves are arithmetically averaged to obtain an overall metric of ecosystem quality. Finally, all sub-models were vetted with interagency partners at a November 2019 workshop and refined accordingly.

For example, Figures 4 and 5 present a general summary of the development of the estuarine, subtidal sub-model. Key references and existing tools are noted along with transient or construction impacts and critical uncertainties. An ecosystem-specific conceptual model is presented. Potential variables are compiled along with specific metrics, assessment methods, and rationale for inclusion or exclusion in NYBEM. Finally, suitability curves are presented for this sub-model (Figure 5). Each sub-model will be presented in a similar detailed format prior to application. All index-based model calculations will be conducted with the \texttt{ecorest} R-package (McKay and Hernandez-Abrams 2020). \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecorest/index.html}{\texttt{ecorest}} is a generic software for conducting suitability index calculations, which will be submitted for USACE National Certification in Summer 2021.

\hypertarget{system-scale-connectivity-model}{%
\subsection{System-Scale, Connectivity Model}\label{system-scale-connectivity-model}}

The index models described above focus on patch-scale outcomes in each of the six nearshore and estuarine ecosystem types, and a broader connectivity model will also be developed to assess outcomes at a system-scale. This analysis will focus on relative changes in hydrologic connectivity between ecosystems, which is defined as the ``water-mediated transfer of matter, energy, and/or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle'' (Pringle 2001). For the purpose of NYBEM, we will focus on connectivity relative to organismal outcomes; for instance, closure gates and storm surge barriers have the potential to disrupt animal movement between different habitat patches required during an organism's life cycle. An analytical approach has not been finalized, but analogous freshwater connectivity models have included issues such as the quantity and quality of habitat patches scaled by movement rates around structures (McKay et al.~2017). For instance, the ``passability'' of a structure could be used to scale the total amount of upstream habitat for a migratory fish such as river herring. These methods could potentially be adapted for multi-directional movement in the context of estuarine connectivity.

\hypertarget{aggregated-model-outcomes}{%
\subsection{Aggregated Model Outcomes}\label{aggregated-model-outcomes}}

Model outcomes from both the patch- and system-scales will need to be aggregated into a small number of summary metrics for USACE decision-makers. All ecological outcomes will estimated at discrete points in time (e.g., 2030, 2080), and a time-averaged assessment of ecological condition (i.e., an ``annualized'' outcome) will provide a consistent means of comparing alternatives over long planning horizons (e.g., 50-years). Furthermore, a given ecosystem type may decline under sea level rise without an agency action, and proposed alternatives should be considered relative to background rates of change.

The NYBEM underwent USACE review and certification from March through April 2022. Models were reviewd by Larry Oliver (USACE New England District, ``Reviewer-1''), Dr.~Kelly Burks-Copes (USACE Galveston District, ``Reviewer-2''), Nate Richards (USACE Headquarters, ``Reviewer-3''), and Alicia Logalbo (USACE Norfolk District, ``Reviewer-4''). All comments follow the four-part comment structure of: (1) identify the problem, (2) describe the technical basis for the comment, (3) rate the significance or impact of the problem, and (4) recommend a mechanism for resolution. Comments and author responses are provided for transparency in review processes and long-term archival.
